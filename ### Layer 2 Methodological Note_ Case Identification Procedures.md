\#\#\# Methodological Note: Case Identification Procedures

\*\*Data sources for the 11 target transparency cases:\*\*

\*\*1. Transparency Project blog analysis:\*\*  
Systematic review of Transparency Project blog posts (2023-2025) to extract case citations referenced as authoritative guidance on transcript access, publication permission, and consent disputes. Case names, citations, and procedural context documented in: \[TP-BlogsAnalyesTable\](https://github.com/WriteTogetherToMakeBetterWorld/family-court-transcript-reality-gap/blob/main/TP-BlogsAnalyesTable)

\*\*2. Solicitor and barrister professional commentary:\*\*  
Review of professional guidance published by legal firms and chambers (Stewart's Law, Irwin Mitchell, Deka Chambers), Barrister Magazine articles, chambers practice notes, and Resolution publications. Sources surveyed documented in: \[SolicitorsBaristersSurveyedBlogs.pdf\](https://github.com/WriteTogetherToMakeBetterWorld/family-court-transcript-reality-gap/blob/main/SolicitorsBaristersSurveyedBlogs.pdf)

\*\*3. JustAnswer solicitor-user exchanges:\*\*  
Analysis of N=47 exchanges where solicitors provided guidance to litigants in person seeking advice on transcript access procedures. Exchanges were coded to identify: (a) cases cited as procedural authority, (b) practical guidance given, (c) workarounds recommended, and (d) barriers acknowledged. Coding framework and results documented in: \[JustAnswerCodingAnalises\_\_4\_.xlsx\](https://github.com/WriteTogetherToMakeBetterWorld/family-court-transcript-reality-gap/blob/main/JustAnswerCodingAnalises\_\_4\_.xlsx)

\*\*4. Cases cited in judicial rulings:\*\*  
Cross-referencing of cases cited within the judgments analyzed throughout this chapter (Axes a-d analysis).

\*\*Database search validation:\*\*  
To test whether these practitioner-identified cases could be discovered through systematic database searching, a validation search was conducted on 26 October 2025 using query: (transcript OR publication OR transcription OR family OR court) across three databases. Search parameters and results documented in: \[DataSetsLinks\&Searches\](https://github.com/WriteTogetherToMakeBetterWorld/family-court-transcript-reality-gap/blob/main/DataSetsLinks%26Searches)

\*\*Limitations:\*\*  
This methodology captures cases that practitioners actively cite when advising parties on transparency procedures, representing "working law" rather than comprehensive doctrinal coverage. Cases that exist but are neither cited in practitioner guidance nor discoverable through database searching remain outside this study's scopeâ€”itself diagnostic evidence of the meta-transparency problem this chapter identifies.
