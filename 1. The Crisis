## 1. Introduction: The Crisis

The family justice system in England and Wales is in profound crisis. As of May 2025, the National Audit Office (NAO) reports that **nearly 50,000 family cases remain unresolved**, comprising **10,121 public law applications** involving children at risk of care or adoption and **37,541 private law disputes** concerning child arrangements.[^1] New case starts reached **65,709 in April to June 2025** — up 2% on the previous year — with **over 4,000 children waiting more than two years** for a substantive hearing.[^2] The statutory 26-week time limit for concluding care proceedings, introduced by the *Children and Families Act 2014*, **has not been met in any reporting year since its enactment** — a failure persisting for over a decade.[^3]

Domestic abuse features in **90% of private law cases**, yet courts routinely fail to recognise or act on it, placing children at risk through a pervasive pro-contact culture.[^4] Advice deserts and digital exclusion leave parents without support, with **33% of the population unable to engage online**.[^5] Appeals collapse because **transcripts — the only verifiable proof of what was said — are late, expensive, or missing**.[^6]

This is not merely a backlog. It is **systemic re-traumatisation** of children and survivors.

The **Family Court’s inaugural Annual Report** (2023–2024) acknowledges a “substantial backlog” but highlights reforms: the relaunched **Public Law Outline**, the **Pathfinder pilot** (reducing private law duration by 11 weeks), and digital systems “starting to bed down”.[^7] Even the President of the Family Division acknowledged in April 2025 that while the Public Law Outline has regained momentum, London’s chronic backlogs and cultural resistance to reform remain entrenched.[^8]

Transparency emerges as a central policy lever, yet a deeper data failure undermines it, as identified by the Transparency Implementation Group (2022) and the Justice Committee (2023): the Family Court remains the least visible jurisdiction in the UK justice system.[^9] According to the NAO, family justice now costs the public **£1.8 billion annually** — yet the average case drags on for up to **70 weeks in London**, leaving over **47,662 families in legal limbo**.[^10]
