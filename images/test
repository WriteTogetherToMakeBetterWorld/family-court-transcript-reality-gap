## 1. Introduction: The Crisis

The family justice system in England and Wales is in **systemic crisis**.  

- **~47,662 unresolved cases** (Dec 2024) – 10,121 public law, 37,541 private law[^1]  
- **65,709 new cases** started Apr–Jun 2025 (+2 % YoY)[^2]  
- **>4,000 children** waiting **>2 years** for a hearing[^1]  
- **26-week statutory limit** for care proceedings **never met** since 2014[^3]  

Domestic abuse appears in **90 % of private law cases**, yet a **pro-contact culture** routinely overrides evidence of harm[^4]. Digital exclusion affects **33 %** of the population; “advice deserts” leave many without support[^5]. Appeals collapse because **transcripts are late, costly, or missing**[^6].  

> **£1.8 bn annual cost** – legal aid per case doubled to **£12,000**[^1]  

This is **systemic re-traumatisation** of children and survivors.

## 2. Reforms Amid Hurdles

| Initiative | Progress (Oct 2023–Sep 2024) |
|------------|------------------------------|
| **Public Law Outline (PLO) Relaunch** | 37 % of public law cases within 26 weeks (highest since pre-pandemic)[^7] |
| **Pathfinder Pilot** (North Wales, SE Wales, Dorset, Birmingham) | Legacy backlog nearly cleared; **11-week average reduction**[^8] |
| **Digital Systems** | “Starting to bed down” – uneven rollout[^7] |

**London remains a black spot**: chronic backlogs, cultural resistance, insufficient judges[^8].  

> **Government response (Oct 2025)** – repeal of the presumption of parental involvement in the Children Act 1989 to better protect children from abusive parents[^9].

---

## 3. Transparency as Catalyst

Transparency entered the agenda with **Sir Andrew McFarlane’s 2021 Transparency Review**[^10].  

### Transparency Implementation Group (TIG) – 5 Sub-Groups  
1. Press attendance & reporting (pilot)  
2. Data collection  
3. Media engagement  
4. Anonymisation & publication of judgments  
5. Transparency in financial remedy cases[^11]  

**Pilot → Nationwide (Jan 2025)**: accredited journalists & legal bloggers can attend & report (subject to anonymity).  

> **Transparency & Open Justice Board** – open justice is the *default* position[^12].

## 4. Transcripts – The Achilles’ Heel

| Symptom | Transparency Fix | Transcript Fix |
|---------|-------------------|----------------|
| **Chronic delays** (36-41 weeks) | Public scrutiny → efficiency | Re-usable templates |
| **Unmet 26-week limit** | Exposes bottlenecks | Data-driven reform |
| **~47 k pending cases** | Workload monitoring | Precedents speed disposal |
| **90 % domestic abuse** | Open proceedings | Irrefutable evidence |
| **Pro-contact bias** | Pattern scrutiny | Exposes biased reasoning |
| **Advice deserts / digital exclusion** | Public case info | Free anonymised database |
| **Transcript inaccessibility** | Administrative oversight | Routine, free publication |

---

## 5. The Data Void – FOI Case Study

**J. Walker FOI (20 May 2025)** → MoJ[^6]  

*Requested*: aggregate transcript stats (Apr 2024–Apr 2025)  
*Result*: **Partial denial** – Section 12(2) cost exemption, “data not held”, incomplete operational answers.  

> **Implication**: No baseline metrics → no accountability.

## 6. Barriers to Transcript Access

### 6.1 Process (Form EX105/EX107)  
- Judicial approval required for non-public funding  
- 10-15 day guideline routinely exceeded  

### 6.2 User Experience (X posts)  
- “£1,000+ for a single transcript”  
- “5-month wait for appeal”  
- “Missing audio → no transcript”  

### 6.3 Procurement  
- £20 m framework (2023) – 8 suppliers  
- No SLAs for speed or transparency  

---

## 7. Policy Implications

Transcripts are **pivotal**. TIG’s data sub-group advances collection for outcomes. AI integration could slash costs/delays. Repealing parental presumptions signals responsiveness, but **without transcript metrics, biases persist unchecked**.

---

## 8. Low-Resistance Interventions

| Area | Action | Owner |
|------|--------|-------|
| **Data** | Quarterly anonymised metrics | TIG Data Sub-Group |
| **Procedure** | Auto-approve routine requests; AI draft pilot | HMCTS |
| **User Support** | Free/low-cost for vulnerable; public database | MoJ |
| **Contracts** | Add delay penalties & open-data clauses | MoJ Procurement |

> **Key Phrases**  
> - *“Family courts reinvent the wheel – transcripts are the blueprint.”*  
> - *“One transcript = more truth than 100 reporters.”*  
> - *“No revolution needed – just transcripts.”*

---

## 9. Conclusion & Call to Action

The family justice crisis demands **evidence-driven reform**. Transparency holds promise, but **transcripts are its foundation**.  

**Policymakers**: Mandate transcript metrics in the next TIG report.  
**Judiciary**: Pilot AI transcription in 3 courts by Q2 2026.  
**Public**: Write to your MP.  
**Journalists**: FOI your local family court transcript stats.
