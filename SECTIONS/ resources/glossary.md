## Glossary

### Core Concepts
**Reality Gap**: The disconnect between transparency principles (open justice, verifiable records) and operational practice (inaccessible transcripts, untimed approvals, no data monitoring). The central thesis of this report.

**Untimed Void**: The critical procedural gap in Form EX107 where send off and judicial approval are uncontrolled, creating structural impossibility of meeting appeal deadlines (Design Failure 6).

**Temporal Justice**: Justice for care-experienced adults seeking access to transcripts of their own childhood proceedings. No dedicated protocol exists; they must use the standard EX107 process with its untimed approval delays and costs, treating their life records as court property, not personal history.

**Design Failure (DF)**: One of 15 specific structural breakdowns identified in the transcript access system (DF-1 through DF-15, detailed in Section 7).
