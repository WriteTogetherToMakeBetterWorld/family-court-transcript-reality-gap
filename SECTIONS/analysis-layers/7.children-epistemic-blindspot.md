# 7.7 The Absent Voice: Children as Epistemic Blind Spot Across All Five Layers

The five-layer analysis revealed interlinked and mutually reinforcing transparency barriers across institutional design (Layer 1), judicial gatekeeping (Layer 2), professional mediation (Layer 3), user experience (Layer 4), and external observation (Layer 5). Yet analysis of these layers exposed a more fundamental absence: **children's perspectives do not structurally inform the transparency system ostensibly designed to serve them**. While the paramountcy principle (Children Act 1989, s.1) requires courts to prioritize children's welfare when deciding individual cases, the policy framework that structures those decisions developed without mechanisms for children to inform what "welfare" means in transparency contexts. This exclusion, documented here through transparency reform, **raises questions about whether mechanisms exist for children to guide design of family court policy more broadly**.

## 7.7.1 The Difficult Questions—And Whether They Should Be Asked At All

The documented systematic exclusion of children's voices from transparency policy raises genuinely difficult questions: At what age, if at all, should children be consulted about publication of judgments concerning them? How should their views be weighted against other considerations? What mechanisms would enable meaningful participation without re-traumatising vulnerable young people? How do we account for developmental capacity, individual variation, and changing perspectives as children mature? What happens when children's expressed preferences conflict with professional assessments of their welfare?

These are complex questions without simple answers. Consultation with children about transparency presents real methodological challenges: children's capacity to understand legal proceedings varies with age and circumstance; power imbalances may inhibit honest expression; trauma may affect their ability to participate; and their views may change over time as they gain distance from events or developmental maturity. These methodological challenges are not unique to family court transparency. Comparable issues arise whenever researchers seek to elicit the views of vulnerable or marginalised participants. Participatory research methodologies across disciplines—from public health to urban planning—have developed frameworks for consulting such groups on complex decisions (Clark & Moss, 2001; Lundy, 2007), suggesting that difficulty presents a methodological challenge rather than an insurmountable barrier.

Recognising the challenge, however, is not the same as accepting exclusion. The difficulty of finding answers does not justify the absence of the questions themselves. The fact that consultation with children presents methodological challenges does not, in principle, excuse designing policy without any mechanism to incorporate their perspectives. Article 12 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC) grants children "the right to express [views] freely in all matters affecting the child," with those views being "given due weight in accordance with the age and maturity of the child" (UNCRC, 1989, Art. 12(1)). A system genuinely committed to children's participatory rights would acknowledge methodological difficulties while creating mechanisms to address them—age-appropriate consultation methods, trauma-informed approaches, longitudinal engagement allowing for changing perspectives, and transparency about when and why children's expressed preferences were overridden. The absence of such mechanisms in current transparency policy development—documented in §7.7.5 below—means that whether difficulty explains exclusion or exclusion occurred for other reasons remains an empirical question that the policy documents themselves do not answer. What can be established is that mechanisms for children to inform policy development are absent, and this absence is inconsistent with children's right to participate in matters affecting them (UNCRC, 1989, Art. 12), even as mechanisms exist for individual children's views to be represented in specific proceedings through Cafcass guardians, children's solicitors, or rule 16.4 guardians (Children Act 1989, s.41).

Yet based on the systematic exclusion documented below, a prior question emerges: should these questions even be asked at all? After designing transparency policy without children's input, implementing frameworks that predetermined answers, and restricting consultation to technical refinements—to now ask children these questions risks asking them to legitimize decisions made without them. This is not an argument that it is "too late" for meaningful consultation (practice guidance can change, and better late than never), but rather an observation about **ethical sequencing**: asking children to **participate in refining predetermined conclusions** differs fundamentally from **inviting children to inform foundational premises before decisions are made**. The 2016 Brophy consultation exemplifies this timing problem—young people were asked to review published judgments and identify anonymisation failures only after publication had been decided, after the legal framework was established, and after policy rationale was determined. Their expressed concerns—"graphic details of the sexual abuse of this child [are] made available to 'the world' for downloading and sharing…forever" (Brophy et al., 2016, p. 1)—suggest profound discomfort with the premise itself, yet the consultation framework required accepting publication as given in order to participate.

Moreover, if children's voices are systematically absent from transparency policy—policy explicitly about making their cases public—this raises a broader question about family court governance: **where else are children excluded from policy development in a system that provides representation mechanisms for individual case decisions?** While children in individual proceedings may be represented by Cafcass guardians, children's solicitors, or rule 16.4 guardians who articulate their views in specific cases (Children Act 1989, s.41), no equivalent mechanism exists for children collectively to inform the policy frameworks that structure how those individual decisions are made. This exclusion, documented here through transparency reform, may be symptomatic rather than exceptional. This article focuses on transparency as its empirical site, but the questions raised potentially extend to all family court policy: by what authority does the system make foundational policy decisions affecting all children subject to proceedings without mechanisms for children to inform those policy frameworks, even as it provides representation for individual children's views in specific cases under UNCRC Article 12 (UNCRC, 1989, Art. 12)?

The sections that follow pursue a specific analytical sequence: first, exploring how current guidance structurally excludes children without legal representation from expressing views on publication decisions (§7.7.1.1); second, establishing the methodological approach required when children have been excluded from policy development (§7.7.2); third, identifying the meta-question that should frame transparency policy when children are subjects of publication (§7.7.3); fourth, examining why current institutional structures prevent this question from being asked (§7.7.4); fifth, presenting evidence of systematic exclusion (§7.7.5); sixth, exploring what subsidiary questions would need to be posed to children in meaningful consultation (§7.7.6).

### 7.7.1.1 The Representation Prerequisite: Structural Exclusion from Publication Consultation

The June 2024 Practice Guidance states that "all parties (including children who are represented, as appropriate) should be notified so that they have an opportunity to make representations about publication and anonymisation" (McFarlane, 2024, para. 3.13, emphasis added). This procedural design creates differential access to participation in publication decisions: children with legal representation—typically those in public law proceedings with appointed solicitors and children's guardians under section 41 of the Children Act 1989—have a procedural mechanism through which to express views on publication of judgments concerning them, while the guidance provides no equivalent mechanism for children without such representation.

This is not a matter of protecting children from complexity or inappropriate participation. Rather, the guidance conditions consultation about publication decisions on existing legal representation, providing no procedural framework for judges to consult children directly about whether judgments concerning them should be published. Practice research suggests such consultation rarely occurs in private law proceedings where children lack representation (Masson & Winn Oakley, 1999). The guidance's phrase "as appropriate" (McFarlane, 2024, para. 3.13) delegates the appropriateness determination to judges without establishing criteria or presumptions, creating discretion that, absent procedural mechanisms, permits exclusion to become the default for children without legal representation.

This procedural design exemplifies what organisational theorists term "structural exclusion": barriers embedded not in explicit policy choices but in system architecture that renders certain actors invisible (Star, 1991). The guidance's silence on consulting children without legal representation about publication decisions creates what Scott (1998) identifies as "legibility" problems—the system can only "see" children who appear through the mediating lens of legal representation in proceedings, rendering other children illegible to the procedural framework for publication consultation. This is structural rather than intentional exclusion: the absence of mechanisms produces invisibility regardless of individual judges' intentions.

This representation prerequisite for publication consultation is inconsistent with foundational principles:

**UNCRC Article 12:** Article 12 grants all children "the right to express [views] freely in all matters affecting the child," with those views being "given due weight in accordance with the age and maturity of the child" (UNCRC, 1989, Art. 12(1)). **This right is not conditioned on legal representation status**. The Committee on the Rights of the Child has emphasised that Article 12 "establishes that every child has the right to express her or his views and that this right applies to 'all matters affecting the child'" (Committee on the Rights of the Child, 2009, para. 15, emphasis in original). Publication of judgments concerning children constitutes "a matter affecting the child." While children in proceedings may have their views represented by Cafcass guardians or solicitors regarding their specific case, the guidance provides no mechanism for children—whether represented in proceedings or not—to express views on the policy question of whether and how publication should occur. The guidance conditions any consultation about publication on existing legal representation (McFarlane, 2024, para. 3.13), creating a procedural barrier to direct consultation even for children who have representatives in their proceedings, and excluding entirely children without such representation from expressing views on publication decisions.

**The paramountcy gap:** The paramountcy principle requires that "the child's welfare shall be the court's paramount consideration" when a court "determines any question with respect to...the upbringing of a child" (Children Act 1989, s.1(1)). This principle applies to individual judicial decisions about specific children—including decisions about whether to publish judgments in particular cases. However, the Practice Guidance that structures how judges approach those decisions was issued by the President of the Family Division in a policy-making capacity. The paramountcy principle does not govern this policy development function.

This creates a structural gap: the framework determining what factors judges consider, what questions they ask, and what "welfare" means in transparency contexts operates outside the principle that governs its application. Judges applying paramountcy in individual cases (balancing Article 8 privacy rights against Article 10 transparency interests for specific children) do so within a policy framework developed without children's input. The Committee on the Rights of the Child has clarified that when best interests are assessed, "the child's interests have high priority and are not just one of several considerations" (Committee on the Rights of the Child, 2013, para. 39). Yet the guidance treats children's privacy interests as one consideration among several to be "balanced" (McFarlane, 2024, para. 3.14), and developed this balancing framework without mechanisms for children to inform how their interests should be prioritized.

This reveals a fundamental displacement: paramountcy operates at the point of application (individual case decisions) but not at the point of framework design (policy development). The system applies paramountcy at the point of least leverage (deciding whether to publish within predetermined guidelines) while operating outside paramountcy at the point of maximum leverage (determining what those guidelines are). Children's voices are excluded from the structural level where foundational questions about whether publication serves them are determined, while paramountcy is invoked at the individual level where judges apply a framework children had no role in shaping.

**Article 6 ECHR:** Article 6 guarantees the right to a fair hearing. While publication decisions occur after proceedings conclude, they determine whether private information about children becomes permanently public. The guidance creates differential procedural access based on representation status rather than the nature of the child's interest in the decision—children with legal representation may be consulted about publication, children without such representation cannot.

This structural feature reveals that epistemic exclusion of children from publication consultation is embedded in procedural design. The guidance could have required judges to consider age-appropriate consultation with all children subject to publication decisions, providing suggested methods and emphasizing that lack of legal representation in proceedings does not preclude direct consultation about publication. Instead, it conditions consultation on representation status, treating children without legal representation as subjects of publication decisions rather than participants in them. This is particularly significant given that private law proceedings—where representation is not routinely provided—often involve disputes over contact, residence, and welfare where children's preferences about whether details of parental conflict, allegations against family members, or their own expressed wishes should become permanently public may be strong.

## 7.7.2 Methodological Reorientation: Finding the Question Before Proposing Solutions

This structural absence of children's voices from policy development presents not merely an empirical gap but a methodological challenge: how can research on transparency policy that affects children be conducted rigorously when the fundamental question guiding that policy remains unexamined? Current transparency debates operate within an assumed framework—that increased publication serves the public interest, subject to anonymisation safeguards—without interrogating whether this framework itself reflects children's interests or perspectives. Before proposing reforms to transparency mechanisms, a prior step is necessary: identifying the fundamental question that should guide transparency policy when children are the subjects of published records.

This methodological reorientation—privileging question-formation over solution-design—is particularly critical when the affected population (children) has been systematically excluded from policy development. Rushing to answers risks embedding the same exclusionary logic that created the current system: adults identifying problems, designing solutions, and implementing reforms without consulting those whose lives are documented in the records being published. The alternative approach, adopted in the analysis that follows, treats question-formation as a substantive research task requiring examination from multiple analytical perspectives—legal, ethical, psychological, developmental, and experiential—before any framework for reform can be proposed.

This methodological stance reflects what feminist epistemologists term "epistemic justice"—recognizing that knowledge production itself can constitute oppression when marginalized groups are systematically excluded from defining the questions that frame inquiry (Fricker, 2007). When adults formulate both questions and answers about children's transparency preferences, this constitutes what Fricker identifies as "hermeneutical injustice": children lack the discursive resources to make their experiences intelligible because the conceptual frameworks through which those experiences are interpreted were developed without their participation. The question-first approach acknowledges this limitation: rather than claiming to know children's answers, this analysis seeks to identify what questions must be asked—and by extension, what consultation mechanisms must be developed—before transparency policy can claim legitimacy under principles of epistemic justice.

## 7.7.3 The Meta-Question: Who Controls Children's Narratives, By What Authority, and For Whose Benefit?

From multiple analytical perspectives—legal, ethical, psychological, developmental, technological, and experiential—one meta-question emerges as foundational to transparency policy when children are the subjects of published records:

> **Who has the right to control the narrative of a child's life, on what basis is that right claimed, by what authority does 'the system' exercise that control, and for whose ultimate benefit does it define, record, and publicize a child's reality?**

This question sits above all analytical frameworks because it interrogates the foundational assumption underlying transparency policy: that the state, via courts, has authority to create and publish authoritative narratives about children's lives to serve systemic purposes (justice, transparency, accountability, legal precedent). This assumption is never defended in transparency guidance—it is treated as axiomatic. The June 2024 Practice Guidance, for instance, begins with the premise that "being transparent includes allowing the public to understand the range of cases in the Family Court and how they are dealt with" and that "the publication of judgments is an essential part of that process" (McFarlane, 2024, p. 1). No consideration is given to whether this premise holds when the "cases" involve children, or whether transparency might be achieved through mechanisms that do not require publishing narratives about individual children's lives.

The meta-question exposes what publication actually does: it asserts that the system's record of a child's life has greater authority, permanence, and publicity than the child's own experience of their life. This claim about narrative sovereignty—the right to define, record, and publicize reality—has profound implications for children's Article 8 ECHR rights to private and family life, which encompass not merely privacy but also personal autonomy and identity formation (Von Hannover v Germany (2005) 40 EHRR 1). When a court publishes a judgment about a child, it creates an institutionally sanctioned narrative with authoritative status that may follow the child into adulthood, shape how others perceive them, and constrain their ability to reframe their own history as understanding evolves. This claim about institutional authority over personal narrative implicates what philosophers of childhood identify as the "personhood paradox"—children are recognized as persons with rights, yet treated as lacking the capacity to exercise authority over their own biographical narratives (Archard, 2004).

These questions engage fundamental issues in narrative theory: who has "narrative authority" (Booth, 1983), whose voice is "authorized" to tell particular stories (Smith & Watson, 2010), and how institutional narratives become privileged over personal accounts. Narrative theorists emphasize that control over one's story is central to identity formation and personal autonomy (Bruner, 2004)—precisely the interests Article 8 ECHR protects. Yet current transparency policy privileges institutional narrative authority without examining the basis for that privilege when applied to children's life stories.

This meta-question reveals five subsidiary questions that transparency policy does not address within its current framework:

**1. The sovereignty question:** Does a child have narrative sovereignty over their own life story, or is childhood a state in which institutional authority legitimately supersedes personal narrative control? Current policy operates on the latter assumption without examination. Children's Article 8 ECHR privacy rights are acknowledged but treated as interests to be "balanced" against transparency goals (McFarlane, 2024, para. 3.14), not as foundational constraints that must be satisfied before publication can occur. Yet the European Court of Human Rights has emphasized that Article 8 protects not merely privacy but "personal autonomy" and the right to "personal development" (Pretty v United Kingdom (2002) 35 EHRR 1, para. 61). Publication of judgments about children implicates these autonomy interests, yet children have no procedural mechanism to assert them in policy development or, often, in individual publication decisions.

**2. The temporal question:** If narrative rights vest with maturity, who legitimately holds them in trust during childhood, and by what standard can we verify that trust is being exercised in the child's interests rather than for institutional convenience? While the paramountcy principle (Children Act 1989, s.1) mandates that children's welfare is the court's paramount consideration in individual case decisions, transparency policy—which structures how courts assess welfare in publication contexts—developed without evidence of what children consider welfare-enhancing about publication of their cases. The Committee on the Rights of the Child has clarified that when best interests are assessed, children's interests must have "high priority" and not be "just one of several considerations" (Committee on the Rights of the Child, 2013, para. 39). Current transparency policy treats children's privacy interests as one consideration among several to be "balanced" (McFarlane, 2024, para. 3.14), yet developed this framework without establishing whether children's interests were given priority in policy design itself.

**3. The conflict question:** When narrative interests conflict—a child's privacy versus the public's claimed interest in transparency—what principle determines priority, and who decides? Current policy resolves this through judicial discretion guided by Article 8/Article 10 ECHR balancing (McFarlane, 2024, para. 3.14), but children are not parties to this balancing exercise at the policy level, and may not be consulted even in individual publication decisions if they lack legal representation. Their interests in individual cases may be represented by proxies (Cafcass, solicitors where appointed) whose institutional positions may not align with children's own preferences. Yet Article 8 jurisprudence emphasizes that interference with private life must be "necessary in a democratic society" and proportionate to legitimate aims (Olsson v Sweden (1988) 11 EHRR 259). How necessity and proportionality are assessed without consulting those whose private life is subject to interference—both at the policy level and often at the individual case level—remains unaddressed.

**4. The permanence question:** Can anyone validly make irreversible narrative decisions (permanent publication) on behalf of a future self who will experience consequences the present decision-maker cannot foresee? A judgment published when a child is 8 years old becomes part of their permanent public record, accessible when they are 18, 28, or 48. No mechanism exists for that future adult to consent to or refuse continued publication. This raises questions under Article 8 ECHR's protection of personal autonomy and identity: the European Court has recognized that "the concept of 'private life' ... covers the physical and psychological integrity of a person" and extends to aspects bearing on personal identity (Pretty v United Kingdom (2002) 35 EHRR 1, para. 61). Yet publication decisions made during childhood permanently shape the publicly available narrative of that person's identity, without mechanisms for the adult to exercise retrospective autonomy over those decisions.

These questions engage fundamental issues in moral philosophy regarding consent, autonomy, and proxy decision-making. Philosophers distinguish between "precedent autonomy" (decisions made by a past self binding a future self) and "concurrent autonomy" (decisions made by one's present self) (Dworkin, 1993). Current transparency policy permits adults to exercise precedent autonomy over children's future selves—decisions made when a child is 8 bind that person at 28—without mechanisms to verify that such precedent autonomy serves the future self's concurrent autonomy interests.

**5. The epistemological question:** Who can know the "true" narrative of a life—the person living it, or institutional observers documenting it? Judgments present judicial interpretation of evidence, but care-experienced adults seeking their childhood histories often report that official records diverge from their lived experience (Selwyn et al., 2006). Publication privileges the institutional narrative as authoritative while constraining the child's ability to tell their own story on their own terms. This implicates Article 10 ECHR's protection of freedom of expression, which "constitutes one of the essential foundations of a democratic society" and applies not merely to information "that are favourably received ... but also to those that offend, shock or disturb" (Handyside v United Kingdom (1976) 1 EHRR 737, para. 49). If the published judgment becomes the authoritative narrative, children's ability to offer competing narratives is constrained by the institutional version's precedence.

Current transparency policy resolves these questions by default rather than deliberation: judicial narrative authority is supreme, children's privacy interests are secondary to systemic transparency goals, and publication decisions are irreversible. Yet these resolutions are never explicitly defended—they are embedded in procedural design. The restricted remit of the Transparency Implementation Group's Publication Guidance Subgroup exemplifies this: by excluding examination of "the legal framework as it currently exists" (Transparency Implementation Group, 2024, para. 3), the subgroup was structurally prevented from asking whether the framework itself—which assumes institutional authority to publish narratives about children without their participation in policy development—is defensible under children's rights frameworks (UNCRC, 1989; ECHR, 1950).

### 7.7.3.1 The Temporal Cascade: How Present Decisions Constrain Future Selves

Current transparency policy treats publication as a binary present-tense decision: publish now or seal now. Both choices have cascading temporal effects that extend decades beyond the decision point, yet neither pathway includes mechanisms for the children who become adults to participate in decisions about their own narratives.

**Scenario 1: Publication now**
- **Year 0 (age 8)**: Record becomes public without child's consent
- **Year 10 (age 18)**: Young adult discovers published judgment, cannot remove it
- **Year 20 (age 28)**: Adult defined by childhood crisis, no "right to be forgotten"

**Scenario 2: Sealing now**
- **Year 0 (age 8)**: Record sealed to protect child
- **Year 10 (age 18)**: Young adult seeking history, cannot access sealed transcript (unlike adoption records under Adoption and Children Act 2002, which grant adopted adults access to their birth records)
- **Year 20 (age 28)**: Adult wishes to authorize anonymized publication to help others, no mechanism exists

Both pathways involve adults making permanent decisions on behalf of future selves who will experience consequences the present decision-maker cannot foresee. A parent or judge determining in 2025 that a child "needs privacy and stability" makes that determination binding on the same individual in 2035, 2045, and beyond, when they may hold entirely different views about whether transparency or privacy serves their interests. The system provides no mechanism to revisit these decisions as children mature, no provision for time-limited sealing with adult review, and no recognition that the 8-year-old subject of proceedings and the 28-year-old seeking to understand their history are, developmentally and legally, different persons with potentially different preferences about transparency. Research with care-experienced adults documents this temporal disjunction: adults seeking to understand childhood proceedings report frustration at discovering published judgments they never consented to, or conversely, inability to access sealed records they wish to examine (Barn et al., 2005).

This temporal asymmetry reflects broader tensions in developmental psychology between protecting children's present welfare and respecting their future autonomy. Developmental theorists emphasize that identity formation is a lifelong process (Erikson, 1968), with adolescents and young adults actively reworking childhood narratives as part of identity consolidation (Habermas & Bluck, 2000). Permanent publication decisions made during childhood constrain this developmental process by fixing an authoritative narrative before the individual has capacity to participate in its construction.

The temporal cascade reveals a fundamental asymmetry: adults can make permanent decisions about children's narratives, but children cannot make even temporary decisions about their own. This asymmetry persists into adulthood—care-experienced adults seeking their childhood proceedings face the same barriers (judicial discretion, cost, application requirements) as any party, with no special provision recognizing their unique retrospective interest in understanding the decisions that shaped their lives.

## 7.7.4 Why the System Cannot Ask This Question

The meta-question—who controls children's narratives, by what authority, and for whose benefit—is structurally excluded from institutional reform processes. Whether this exclusion occurs because asking the question would destabilize institutional interests, or for other reasons policy documents do not articulate, the effect is that foundational premises remain unexamined. If transparency policy genuinely asked "by what right do we control children's narratives?", the inquiry might conclude: "We have power to publish, but not necessarily right. Publication may be an exercise of institutional power legitimated through transparency discourse rather than a defensible claim to narrative authority over children's lives."

This conclusion would destabilize multiple institutional interests:

**Judicial authority:** Judges' institutional power depends partly on their role as definitive narrators of legal reality. Published judgments do more than record decisions—they establish authoritative accounts of what happened, why it matters, and what it means. If children (or adults reflecting on their childhoods) can contest these narratives, judicial authority to define reality faces challenge.

**Legal precedent systems:** Common law development requires published judgments creating binding narratives. If children's cases cannot be published, entire areas of family law lose their precedential foundation. The system's answer—"we must publish to maintain precedent"—treats legal architecture as non-negotiable and children's narrative sovereignty as expendable.

**Professional legitimacy:** Legal professionals' expertise is demonstrated through public cases and published reasoning. Barristers build reputations on reported judgments; judges establish authority through influential decisions; academics analyze published cases. If children's narratives cannot be appropriated for these professional purposes, the demonstrable expertise of family law practitioners diminishes.

**Reform infrastructure:** Transparency advocates require visible case examples to demonstrate systemic problems. Campaign groups, journalists, and academics rely on published judgments to evidence court failures, advocate for change, and hold institutions accountable. If children's cases are sealed, this infrastructure loses its raw material.

Institutional theorists term this "structural isomorphism": organizations adopt practices that maintain legitimacy within their institutional field, even when those practices conflict with stated goals (DiMaggio & Powell, 1983). The transparency reform process exhibits isomorphic features—consultation structures mirror existing professional networks (judges, lawyers, academics) rather than incorporating stakeholders (children) who would disrupt established patterns of authority. This is not conspiracy but organizational logic: institutions preferentially hear from actors whose participation reinforces rather than challenges existing structures (Clegg, 1989).

The Transparency Implementation Group's restricted remit demonstrates this dynamic: the subgroup could discuss how many judgments to publish and which types to prioritize, but could not examine whether publication itself serves children's interests or whether alternative transparency mechanisms might achieve systemic goals without appropriating children's narratives (Transparency Implementation Group, 2024, para. 3). This creates a self-validating loop: transparency is assumed beneficial; implementation details are debated; children's exclusion from policy debates may be rationalized as protecting them from complexity; and the resulting policy is cited as evidence of "careful consideration." At no point does the fundamental question—by what right?—enter the inquiry, because the policy framework was designed to preclude it.

### 7.7.4.1 The Representation-Voice Distinction

Children in family proceedings may be represented by institutional proxies: Cafcass guardians who assess and articulate children's best interests; children's solicitors appointed in some cases under section 41 Children Act 1989; and local authority social workers who document children's circumstances and wishes. But representation in proceedings is not voice in policy development.

When transparency policy is examined through these representatives' perspectives, we learn whether Cafcass thinks publication is appropriate, whether social workers believe a case merits public attention, whether judges consider transparency serves children's interests. What remains unknown is what children themselves think about transparency, because age-appropriate consultation with children about policy questions is not routine practice. The system presumes children lack capacity to engage with transparency questions at the policy level, and often at the individual publication decision level. Despite UNCRC Article 12 granting children the right to express views in matters affecting them, when children's "wishes and feelings" appear in Cafcass reports or social services assessments about individual cases, they are paraphrased, summarized, and contextualized by professional judgment (Thomas & O'Kane, 1998). The policy-level question—"should cases like yours be published?"—is not posed to children. Even the individual-level question—"do you want this specific case made public?"—is rarely posed directly to children during crisis (domestic violence, care proceedings, parental dispute), and may be considered too complex for most children to meaningfully answer.

Sociolinguistic research demonstrates that "voice" and "representation" constitute distinct phenomena: voice involves authentic expression in one's own words and chosen medium, while representation necessarily involves translation and interpretation through another's linguistic and conceptual framework (Bakhtin, 1981). When professionals "represent" children's views in individual cases, they engage in what discourse analysts term "voicing"—animating another's perspective through their own utterance (Goffman, 1981)—which inevitably transforms the original expression through the representative's interpretive lens.

This creates an accountability void: adults decide transparency frameworks for children without systematic evidence of what children value. Current policy operates without empirical basis regarding children's actual preferences about publication policy, presuming alignment with institutional approaches—a presumption that may prioritize adult perspectives over children's own assessments of their welfare. The 2016 NYAS consultation revealed young people's distress at discovering published details of their abuse—"many felt let down" (Brophy et al., 2016, p. 19)—yet this finding did not prompt systematic consultation with children about whether publication serves their interests, either at the policy level or in routine individual publication decisions.

## 7.7.5 Evidence of Systematic Exclusion from Policy Development

The June 2024 Practice Guidance, *Transparency in the Family Courts: Publication of Judgments*, issued by Sir Andrew McFarlane, President of the Family Division (hereinafter "June 2024 Practice Guidance"), illustrates the pattern of exclusion identified above. While the President's foreword claims the guidance was "produced by a group...made up of judges, legal advisers, practitioners, CAFCASS, ADCS and young people from the FJYPB" (McFarlane, 2024, p. 1), the Publication Guidance Subgroup that actually drafted publication recommendations consisted of six legal professionals—judges, barristers, and academics—with no documented participation by FJYPB representatives acting in their capacity as representatives of young people's perspectives (Transparency Implementation Group, 2024, para. 4).

This pattern is consistent with the 2016 Brophy research consultation, where young people from NYAS were asked to review published judgments to identify anonymisation failures and distressing content, but were not consulted on whether publication itself serves children's interests or what alternative transparency mechanisms might better protect their welfare (Brophy, Perry & Harrison, 2016).[^1] Both consultations share a critical design feature: restricted scope that structurally prevents children's fundamental concerns from informing policy.

The 2024 subgroup's remit was explicitly confined to "the number of judgments that judges ought to publish" and "the types of judgments that might be deemed priority for publication," while excluding any "overview or commentary on the legal framework as it currently exists" (Transparency Implementation Group, 2024, paras. 2-3). Similarly, the 2016 consultation focused on improving anonymisation *within* the existing publication framework. By restricting inquiry to implementation details while forbidding examination of foundational premises, both exercises ensured that children's primary concerns—"should our cases be published at all?" and "what alternative transparency mechanisms exist?"—could not inform policy, because these questions arise at the level of analysis the inquiry was designed to exclude.

[^1]: The 2016 Brophy research engaged eight young people aged 17-25 from the National Youth Advocacy Service (NYAS) to analyze 21 published judgments. Their analysis revealed that 29% of judgments contained at least four "within county" geographic markers placing children at high risk of identification; 81% contained information about extended family members aiding jigsaw identification; and young people were able to locate media coverage for 24% of cases and social media coverage for 33% of cases (Brophy et al., 2016, Appendix 1, pp. 18-19). Young people expressed shock at finding graphic details in the public domain—"graphic details of the sexual abuse of this child [are] made available to 'the world' for downloading and sharing…forever" (p. 1)—concerns suggesting discomfort with the *premise* of publication. Yet policy response focused on technical improvements rather than questioning premises. Young people reported they "felt let down" by a system ostensibly designed to protect them (p. 19).

### 7.7.5.1 Multi-Layer Exclusion Pattern

This absence compounds across all five analytical layers:

| Layer | Adult Voice Present | Children's Voice Absent | Consequence |

| **L1: Institutional Design** | MOJ/HMCTS design forms, guidance, procedures | Forms presume adult applicants; no provisions for children requesting their own records | Children cannot initiate access to transcripts of proceedings about their lives |
| **L2: Judicial Gatekeeping** | Judges apply paramountcy in individual cases, exercise discretion on publication | 2016: NYAS young people consulted on anonymisation practices but not on whether publication serves their interests; June 2024 Guidance conditions consultation on legal representation (para. 3.13); Policy framework developed outside paramountcy principle; Children's views represented in individual cases through Cafcass/solicitors but children not consulted on policy frameworks | Judges decide "in children's interests" within framework children didn't inform; even when individual children's views are represented in cases or consulted about policy, framing limits what questions they can address; children without legal representation have no mechanism to express views on publication decisions in their specific cases |
| **L3: Professional Mediation** | Solicitors/barristers navigate procedures, develop informal expertise | In individual cases, lawyers represent children's interests as interpreted by professionals; in policy development, children's perspectives are absent entirely; direct participation by children in either context remains rare | Children's preferences in individual cases filtered through professional judgment, rarely articulated directly; voice conflated with representation; no mechanisms for children's collective input into policy |
| **L4: User Experience** | Parents/litigants report barriers (costs, delays, complexity) | Children are "users" whose life histories are documented but who cannot access records | Ultimate stakeholders excluded from system designed for their benefit |
| **L5: External Observation** | Transparency Project, media, researchers monitor transparency implementation | 2016: Young people analyzed published judgments, expressed concerns about exposure; Children cannot observe proceedings about themselves; their perspectives absent from transparency debates | Policy discourse occurs entirely among adults; children's input confined to technical review; foundational policy questions remain unexamined |

The four focus groups conducted for the June 2024 Practice Guidance consulted 28 legal professionals about judicial workload and anonymisation concerns; no focus groups consulted young people (Transparency Implementation Group, 2024, paras. 9-15). This represents a regression from even the limited 2016 consultation, which at least gave young people the opportunity to express concerns about published judgments—even if those concerns were not incorporated into foundational policy review.

## 7.7.6 Children's Perspective: What Questions Would They Want Us to Ask Them?

One question can be posed without claiming to know children's answers: **What questions would children want us to ask them before publishing records about their lives?** This reframes inquiry from adults determining what serves children's interests to adults acknowledging they cannot know without asking.

Based on research with care-experienced young people (Munro, 2001), children's rights frameworks (Lundy, 2007; UNCRC, 1989), developmental psychology literature (Howe, 2005), and the 2016 NYAS consultation findings (Brophy et al., 2016), consultation addressing children's perspectives on transparency would need to pose questions across several domains:

**Immediate impact questions (while they are children):**
- Who in my life will be able to identify this is about me, even with names changed?
- Will the children at my school find this? What will they think of me?
- What private information that I shared in confidence (or that my family shared) will become public?
- Does this make me "the bad kid" or "the victim kid" forever?
- Can I say no? If I can't say no, why are adults making decisions about my privacy?
- Will my parents be angry at me for what's written in the judgment?

**Future self questions (anticipating adulthood):**
- When I'm 25 and trying to move forward with my life, will this judgment be the first search result for my name?
- Did you realize this would be here forever—that future employers, partners, or my own children might find it?
- If I later understand what happened differently than the judge did, who gets to tell my story—the published judgment or me?
- Should I be able to review and consent (or refuse consent) to continued publication once I'm an adult?
- Why was my right to tell my own story on my own terms, in my own time, decided by others?

**Process questions (about rights and power):**
- Why wasn't I asked before this decision was made?
- If I object, does my objection matter, or does publication happen anyway?
- Who decided that transparency goals are more important than my privacy, and why don't I get input into that decision?
- Why am I too young to consent to publication but not too young to have my case published without consent?
- What makes you think you understand what's good for me better than I do?

**Systemic alternatives questions (about necessity):**
- Could transparency be achieved through statistics about court performance rather than publishing my specific case?
- Why is publishing individual children's stories the only transparency mechanism being pursued?
- Have you proven that publication actually improves the family court system, or is transparency an unexamined assumption?
- If you had to publish, why not restrict it to professional databases rather than the open internet?
- Could you use composite cases (combining elements from multiple cases) instead of my actual story?

**Harm and benefit questions (about justification):**
- How does publishing my case help me specifically?
- If it doesn't help me, why is it fair to use my trauma as a teaching tool for others?
- You say publication serves "the public interest"—but who decided the public's interest matters more than my privacy?
- What evidence do you have that publishing judgments makes courts work better for children?
- If you can't prove benefit and can't eliminate risk, why are you doing this?

**Temporal agency questions (about future self):**
- If you seal this now to protect me, will I be able to access it when I'm older to understand what happened?
- What if I want privacy now but want transparency later—or the reverse?
- Why do adults' 2025 predictions about what I'll need in 2035 or 2045 override my ability to decide for myself when I'm an adult?
- Shouldn't there be a mechanism to review the sealing decision when I turn 18, like there is for adoption records?
- If other adults made this record about me, shouldn't I get to decide what happens to it once I'm old enough to understand?

The absence of mechanisms to pose these questions—let alone respond to children's answers—demonstrates that current transparency policy operates on untested assumptions about what serves children, rather than evidence of children's actual preferences or experiences. More fundamentally, the questions reveal a burden-of-proof inversion: children are implicitly required to prove harm from publication (and can only do so through adult proxies in individual cases, and not at all at the policy level), rather than the system being required to prove benefit to the specific child whose narrative is being appropriated.

The meta-question posed in §7.7.3 encompasses all these subsidiary questions: they are various ways of asking "by what authority, and for whose benefit, do you control my narrative?" Different children at different developmental stages might emphasize different aspects—younger children focusing on immediate social consequences, adolescents on autonomy and consent, care-experienced adults on retrospective access and narrative ownership—but all variations interrogate the same foundational claim: that the system has legitimate authority to define, record, and publicize their reality without their meaningful participation in that decision at either the policy or individual case level.

### 7.7.6.1 Transcripts as Future Memory: The Unique Value for Children

Transcripts hold distinctive significance for children as the only verbatim record of life-altering events. When care-experienced adults retrospectively seek their histories, they encounter judgments (judicial interpretation and reasoning—what the judge decided and why), social care files (local authority accounts, assessments, and interventions—what professionals observed and recommended), and Cafcass reports (guardian analysis of best interests—what was advocated on their behalf). But only transcripts capture what was actually said in proceedings—testimony examined, evidence challenged, arguments presented, children's own words (when given), or what was omitted about their wishes. Transcripts are the unmediated record, preserving dialogue that shaped childhood in ways judgments and reports cannot fully convey.

Yet transcripts remain systematically inaccessible even to adults seeking retrospective understanding. The 18-year-old cannot access the transcript of proceedings that determined their care order at age 8. This creates what might be termed a "reality gap": official records (judgments, social files) may diverge from memory and lived experience, yet the verbatim record that might reconcile or explain these divergences is denied. Research on care-experienced young people documents frustration with inaccessible histories—being told "it was decided in your best interests" without ability to verify what was actually considered, what their younger self said, or whether their voice was accurately represented (Neil et al., 2010). This informational asymmetry undermines trust in institutions and may deter future help-seeking, precisely opposite the system's protective intent.

Memory studies scholars emphasize the distinction between "communicative memory" (personal, biographical memory transmitted through interaction) and "cultural memory" (institutionalized, documented memory with claims to factual authority) (Assmann, 2008). Published judgments constitute cultural memory—institutionally sanctioned narratives with authoritative status. When children become adults seeking their histories, they encounter this cultural memory as authoritative, potentially displacing or contradicting their communicative memory. Yet they had no opportunity to contest or contribute to the cultural memory's construction, creating what memory theorists term "narrative foreclosure"—the premature fixing of an authoritative account before the subject can participate in its formation (Freeman, 2010).

The transcript-as-future-memory function is unique to children among system users. Adult litigants seeking transcripts typically do so for appeals (time-limited) or tactical purposes (ongoing proceedings). Children's interest is different: understanding their own history. Current transcript policy treats children's interest as identical to adults'—requiring application via EX107, judicial approval, cost payment—rather than recognizing this distinctive retrospective function.

The temporal dimension of transcript access becomes particularly acute when parents disagree about transparency. A parent arguing against publication in 2025—citing children's need for privacy and stability—makes a determination that becomes binding on those children in 2035, 2045, and beyond, when they may hold entirely different views about whether understanding their history requires access to sealed transcripts. The system provides no mechanism for children, once adult, to override parental assessments of their privacy interests made decades earlier, even though the Adoption and Children Act 2002 provides exactly such a mechanism for adopted adults seeking their birth records. This asymmetry suggests that family court transparency policy has not addressed children's status as future adults with retrospective information needs, treating them instead as perpetual subjects of parental and judicial narrative control.

Unlike adoption records, which are subject to post-18 access rights under the Adoption and Children Act 2002, family court transcripts have no analogous preserved-access mechanism. Care-experienced adults seeking to understand their histories face the same barriers as any party: application, judicial discretion, cost. The absence of evidence regarding children's actual preferences—whether some prioritize absolute privacy, some value accurate preservation even without publication, or some (particularly adolescents and care-experienced adults) might consent to anonymized publication if it prevents similar harms to others—is itself a design failure.

## 7.7.7 Epistemic Blindness as Structural Feature

This multi-layer exclusion reveals that epistemic blindness about children is not incidental oversight but structural feature. The system cannot know what it does not know because it was never designed to incorporate the knowledge of those it purports to serve. While the paramountcy principle (Children Act 1989, s.1) requires courts to prioritize children's welfare when deciding individual cases, and while mechanisms exist for individual children's views to be represented in proceedings through Cafcass guardians or solicitors, the policy framework that structures how those individual decisions are made developed without mechanisms for children collectively to inform what "welfare" means in transparency contexts, what risks matter to them, and what alternative mechanisms might better serve their interests.

Organizational learning theorists distinguish between "single-loop learning" (modifying practices to achieve existing goals) and "double-loop learning" (questioning the goals themselves) (Argyris & Schön, 1978). Transparency reform exhibits single-loop learning characteristics: the system modifies publication practices (how many judgments, what anonymization) without questioning foundational premises (whether publication serves children's interests, whether children should inform policy). This creates what Argyris terms "organizational defensive routines"—patterns that prevent the organization from learning about its own limitations. The exclusion of children from policy development ensures the system cannot learn what it does not know, because those who could provide that knowledge are structurally prevented from participating in knowledge production about policy frameworks, even as they may be represented in individual cases.

This constitutes a fundamental contradiction: decisions made "in children's best interests" without mechanisms for children to articulate those interests at the policy level, based on adult presumptions about what children need to know about their own lives. While courts apply paramountcy when deciding individual publication cases, and while individual children's views may be represented in proceedings, the framework guiding those decisions was developed through processes that exclude children's perspectives. UNCRC Article 12 grants children the right to express views "in all matters affecting the child," yet transparency policy—explicitly about making children's cases public—developed without mechanisms for children to express views on whether, how, or under what conditions their cases should be published, either collectively at the policy level or routinely in individual publication decisions.

The evidence documented in this chapter—the representation prerequisite for publication consultation (§7.7.1.1), the paramountcy gap between individual case decisions and policy development (§7.7.1.1), the restricted consultation scope (§7.7.5), the multi-layer exclusion pattern distinguishing between representation in proceedings and voice in policy (§7.7.5.1), and the absence of mechanisms to pose fundamental questions at either level (§7.7.6)—demonstrates that this is not oversight but embedded design. The system has not failed to include children; it was structured in ways that render their inclusion in policy development impossible without fundamental redesign of consultation frameworks, and that render their participation in individual publication decisions contingent on legal representation status rather than recognized as a right.

## Conclusion: Toward Child-Centered Inquiry

This analysis has identified the meta-question that should guide transparency policy when children are subjects of publication (§7.7.3), examined why current institutional structures preclude this question (§7.7.4), documented systematic exclusion across policy development (§7.7.5), and outlined what subsidiary questions would need to be posed to children in meaningful consultation (§7.7.6). What this analysis cannot do—and what no adult-authored analysis can do—is answer these questions on children's behalf.

The methodological reorientation proposed in §7.7.2—privileging question-formation over solution-design—requires a corresponding shift in research practice: from analyzing transparency policy about children to conducting transparency research with children as partners. This article therefore enters a new phase beyond this chapter: direct consultation with children and care-experienced young adults to ascertain what transparency mechanisms, if any, they believe would serve their interests without violating their narrative sovereignty.

Section 8 will present the consultation design, findings, and reform proposals informed by children's actual responses rather than adult assumptions. Critically, the consultation will address not only children's present preferences but their views on future access: whether sealing decisions should be time-limited, whether adults should be able to authorize retrospective publication of their childhood proceedings, and whether the temporal cascade identified in §7.7.3.1 represents a fundamental design flaw in current policy. That section cannot be written until the consultation occurs—to do otherwise would reproduce the epistemic violence this chapter exposes: adults claiming to know what children need without asking them, and adults making permanent decisions on behalf of future selves without mechanisms to verify those decisions serve the interests of the person those children become.
