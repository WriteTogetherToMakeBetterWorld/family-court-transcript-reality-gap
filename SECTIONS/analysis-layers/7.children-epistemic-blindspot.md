# 7.7 The Absent Voice: Children as Epistemic Blind Spot Across All Five Layers

The five-layer analysis revealed interlinked and mutually reinforcing transparency barriers across institutional design (Layer 1), judicial gatekeeping (Layer 2), professional mediation (Layer 3), user experience (Layer 4), and external observation (Layer 5). Yet analysis of these layers exposed a more fundamental absence: **children's perspectives do not structurally inform the transparency system ostensibly designed to serve them**. While the paramountcy principle (Children Act 1989, s.1) requires courts to prioritize children's welfare when deciding individual cases, the policy framework that structures those decisions developed without mechanisms for children to inform what "welfare" means in transparency contexts. This exclusion, documented here through transparency reform, **raises questions about whether mechanisms exist for children to guide design of family court policy more broadly**.

## 7.7.1 The Difficult Questions—And Whether They Should Be Asked At All

The documented systematic exclusion of children's voices from transparency policy raises genuinely difficult questions: At what age, if at all, should children be consulted about publication of judgments concerning them? How should their views be weighted against other considerations? What mechanisms would enable meaningful participation without re-traumatising vulnerable young people? How do we account for developmental capacity, individual variation, and changing perspectives as children mature? What happens when children's expressed preferences conflict with professional assessments of their welfare?

These are complex questions without simple answers. Consultation with children about transparency presents real methodological challenges: children's capacity to understand legal proceedings varies with age and circumstance; power imbalances may inhibit honest expression; trauma may affect their ability to participate; and their views may change over time as they gain distance from events or developmental maturity. These methodological challenges are not unique to family court transparency. Comparable issues arise whenever researchers seek to elicit the views of vulnerable or marginalised participants. Participatory research methodologies across disciplines—from public health to urban planning—have developed frameworks for consulting such groups on complex decisions (Clark & Moss, 2001; Lundy, 2007), suggesting that difficulty presents a methodological challenge rather than an insurmountable barrier.

Recognising the challenge, however, is not the same as accepting exclusion. The difficulty of finding answers does not justify the absence of the questions themselves. The fact that consultation with children presents methodological challenges does not, in principle, excuse designing policy without any mechanism to incorporate their perspectives. Article 12 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC) grants children "the right to express [views] freely in all matters affecting the child," with those views being "given due weight in accordance with the age and maturity of the child" (UNCRC, 1989, Art. 12(1)). A system genuinely committed to children's participatory rights would acknowledge methodological difficulties while creating mechanisms to address them—age-appropriate consultation methods, trauma-informed approaches, longitudinal engagement allowing for changing perspectives, and transparency about when and why children's expressed preferences were overridden. The absence of such mechanisms in current transparency policy development—documented in §7.7.5 below—means that whether difficulty explains exclusion or exclusion occurred for other reasons remains an empirical question that the policy documents themselves do not answer. **What can be established is that mechanisms for children to inform policy development are absent, and this absence is inconsistent with children's right to participate in matters affecting them** (UNCRC, 1989, Art. 12), even as mechanisms exist for individual children's views to be represented in specific proceedings through Cafcass guardians, children's solicitors, or rule 16.4 guardians (Children Act 1989, s.41).

Yet based on the systematic exclusion documented below, a prior question emerges: should these questions even be asked at all? After designing transparency policy without children's input, implementing frameworks that predetermined answers, and restricting consultation to technical refinements—to now ask children these questions risks asking them to legitimise decisions made without them. This is not an argument that it is "too late" for meaningful consultation (practice guidance can change), but rather an observation about **ethical sequencing**: asking children to **participate in refining predetermined conclusions** differs fundamentally from **inviting children to inform foundational premises before decisions are made**. The 2016 Brophy consultation exemplifies this timing problem—young people were asked to review published judgments and identify anonymisation failures only after publication had been decided, after the legal framework was established, and after policy rationale was determined. Their expressed concerns—"graphic details of the sexual abuse of this child [are] made available to 'the world' for downloading and sharing…forever" (Brophy et al., 2016, p. 1)—suggest profound discomfort with the premise itself, yet the consultation framework required accepting publication as given in order to participate.

Moreover, if children's voices are systematically absent from transparency policy—policy explicitly about making their cases public—this raises a broader question about family court governance: **where else are children excluded from policy development in a system that provides representation mechanisms for individual case decisions?** While children in individual proceedings may be represented by Cafcass guardians, children's solicitors, or rule 16.4 guardians who articulate their views in specific cases (Children Act 1989, s.41), no equivalent mechanism exists for children collectively to inform the policy frameworks that structure how those individual decisions are made. This exclusion, documented here through transparency reform, may be symptomatic rather than exceptional. This article focuses on transparency as its empirical site, but the questions raised potentially extend to all family court policy: **by what authority does the system make foundational policy decisions affecting all children subject to proceedings without mechanisms for children to inform those policy frameworks**, even as it provides representation for individual children's views in specific cases under UNCRC Article 12 (UNCRC, 1989, Art. 12)?

The sections that follow pursue a specific analytical sequence: first, exploring how current guidance structurally excludes children without legal representation from expressing views on publication decisions (§7.7.1.1); second, establishing the methodological approach required when children have been excluded from policy development (§7.7.2); third, identifying the meta-question that should frame transparency policy when children are subjects of publication (§7.7.3); fourth, examining why current institutional structures prevent this question from being asked (§7.7.4); fifth, presenting evidence of systematic exclusion (§7.7.5); sixth, exploring what subsidiary questions would need to be posed to children in meaningful consultation (§7.7.6).

### 7.7.1.1 The Representation Prerequisite: Structural Exclusion from Publication Consultation

The June 2024 Practice Guidance states that "all parties (including children who are represented, as appropriate) should be notified so that they have an opportunity to make representations about publication and anonymisation" (McFarlane, 2024, para. 3.13, emphasis added). This procedural design creates differential access to participation in publication decisions: children with legal representation—typically those in public law proceedings with appointed solicitors and children's guardians under section 41 of the Children Act 1989—have a procedural mechanism through which to express views on publication of judgments concerning them, while the guidance provides no equivalent mechanism for children without such representation.

This is not a matter of protecting children from complexity or inappropriate participation. Rather, the guidance conditions consultation about publication decisions on existing legal representation, providing no procedural framework for judges to consult children directly about whether judgments concerning them should be published. Practice research suggests such consultation rarely occurs in private law proceedings where children lack representation (Masson & Winn Oakley, 1999). The guidance's phrase "as appropriate" (McFarlane, 2024, para. 3.13) delegates the appropriateness determination to judges without establishing criteria or presumptions, creating discretion that, absent procedural mechanisms, permits exclusion to become the default for children without legal representation.

This procedural design exemplifies what organisational theorists term "structural exclusion": barriers embedded not in explicit policy choices but in system architecture that renders certain actors invisible (Star, 1991). The guidance's silence on consulting children without legal representation about publication decisions creates what Scott (1998) identifies as "legibility" problems—the system can only "see" children who appear through the mediating lens of legal representation in proceedings, rendering other children illegible to the procedural framework for publication consultation. This is structural rather than intentional exclusion: the absence of mechanisms produces invisibility regardless of individual judges' intentions.

This representation prerequisite for publication consultation is inconsistent with foundational principles:

**UNCRC Article 12:** Article 12 grants all children "the right to express [views] freely in all matters affecting the child," with those views being "given due weight in accordance with the age and maturity of the child" (UNCRC, 1989, Art. 12(1)). **This right is not conditioned on legal representation status**. The Committee on the Rights of the Child has emphasised that Article 12 "establishes that every child has the right to express her or his views and that this right applies to 'all matters affecting the child'" (Committee on the Rights of the Child, 2009, para. 15, emphasis in original). Publication of judgments concerning children constitutes "a matter affecting the child." While children in proceedings may have their views represented by Cafcass guardians or solicitors regarding their specific case, **the guidance provides no mechanism for children—whether represented in proceedings or not—to express views on the policy question of whether and how publication should occur**. The guidance conditions any consultation about publication on existing legal representation (McFarlane, 2024, para. 3.13), creating a procedural barrier to direct consultation even for children who have representatives in their proceedings, and excluding entirely children without such representation from expressing views on publication decisions.

**The paramountcy gap:** The paramountcy principle requires that "the child's welfare shall be the court's paramount consideration" when a court "determines any question with respect to...the upbringing of a child" (Children Act 1989, s.1(1)). This principle applies to individual judicial decisions about specific children—including decisions about whether to publish judgments in particular cases. However, the Practice Guidance that structures how judges approach those decisions was issued by the President of the Family Division in a policy-making capacity. The paramountcy principle does not govern this policy development function.

This creates a structural gap: the framework determining what factors judges consider, what questions they ask, and what "welfare" means in transparency contexts operates outside the principle that governs its application. Judges applying paramountcy in individual cases (balancing Article 8 privacy rights against Article 10 transparency interests for specific children) do so within a policy framework developed without children's input. The Committee on the Rights of the Child has clarified that when best interests are assessed, "the child's interests have high priority and are not just one of several considerations" (Committee on the Rights of the Child, 2013, para. 39). Yet the guidance treats children's privacy interests as one consideration among several to be "balanced" (McFarlane, 2024, para. 3.14), and developed this balancing framework without mechanisms for children to inform how their interests should be prioritised.

This reveals a fundamental displacement: **paramountcy operates at the point of application (individual case decisions) but not at the point of framework design (policy development)**. The system applies paramountcy at the point of least leverage (deciding whether to publish within predetermined guidelines) while operating outside paramountcy at the point of maximum leverage (determining what those guidelines are). Children's voices are excluded from the structural level where foundational questions about whether publication serves them are determined, while paramountcy is invoked at the individual level where judges apply a framework children had no role in shaping.

**Article 6 ECHR:** Article 6 guarantees the right to a fair hearing. While publication decisions occur after proceedings conclude, they determine whether private information about children becomes permanently public. The guidance creates differential procedural access based on representation status rather than the nature of the child's interest in the decision—children with legal representation may be consulted about publication, children without such representation cannot.

This structural feature reveals that epistemic exclusion of children from publication consultation is embedded in procedural design. The guidance could have required judges to consider age-appropriate consultation with all children subject to publication decisions, providing suggested methods and emphasising that lack of legal representation in proceedings does not preclude direct consultation about publication. Instead, it conditions consultation on representation status, treating children without legal representation as subjects of publication decisions rather than participants in them. This is particularly significant given that private law proceedings—where representation is not routinely provided—often involve disputes over contact, residence, and welfare where children's preferences about whether details of parental conflict, allegations against family members, or their own expressed wishes should become permanently public may be strong.

## 7.7.2 Methodological Reorientation: Finding the Question Before Proposing Solutions

This structural absence of children's voices from policy development presents not merely an empirical gap but a methodological challenge: how can research on transparency policy that affects children be conducted rigorously when the fundamental question guiding that policy remains unexamined? Current transparency debates operate within an assumed framework—that increased publication serves the public interest, subject to anonymisation safeguards—without interrogating whether this framework itself reflects children's interests or perspectives. Before proposing reforms to transparency mechanisms, a prior step is necessary: identifying the fundamental question that should guide transparency policy when children are the subjects of published records.

This methodological reorientation—privileging question-formation over solution-design—is particularly critical when the affected population (children) has been systematically excluded from policy development. Rushing to answers risks embedding the same exclusionary logic that created the current system: adults identifying problems, designing solutions, and implementing reforms without consulting those whose lives are documented in the records being published. The alternative approach, adopted in the analysis that follows, treats question-formation as a substantive research task requiring examination from multiple analytical perspectives—legal, ethical, psychological, developmental, and experiential—before any framework for reform can be proposed.

This methodological stance reflects what feminist epistemologists term "epistemic justice"—recognising that knowledge production itself can constitute oppression when marginalised groups are systematically excluded from defining the questions that frame inquiry (Fricker, 2007). When adults formulate both questions and answers about matters affecting children, this constitutes what Fricker identifies as "hermeneutical injustice": children lack the discursive resources to make their experiences intelligible because the conceptual frameworks through which those experiences are interpreted were developed without their participation. The question-first approach acknowledges this limitation: rather than claiming to know children's answers, this analysis seeks to identify what questions must be asked—and by extension, what consultation mechanisms must be developed—before transparency policy can claim legitimacy under principles of epistemic justice.

## 7.7.3 The Meta-Question: Who Controls Children's Narratives, By What Authority, and For Whose Benefit?

From multiple analytical perspectives—legal, ethical, psychological, developmental, technological, and experiential—one meta-question emerges as foundational to transparency policy when children are the subjects of published records:

> **Who has the right to control the narrative of a child's life, on what basis is that right claimed, by what authority does 'the system' exercise that control, and for whose ultimate benefit does it define, record, and publicise a child's reality?**

This question sits above all analytical frameworks because it interrogates the foundational assumption underlying transparency policy: that the state, via courts, has authority to create and publish authoritative narratives about children's lives to serve systemic purposes (justice, transparency, accountability, legal precedent). This assumption is never defended in transparency guidance—it is treated as axiomatic. The June 2024 Practice Guidance, for instance, begins with the premise that "being transparent includes allowing the public to understand the range of cases in the Family Court and how they are dealt with" and that "the publication of judgments is an essential part of that process" (McFarlane, 2024, p. 1). 

**But what if this premise is wrong? What if children—or care-experienced adults reflecting on decisions made about them as children—would reject this framing entirely?**

The question is not whether transparency through publication is correct, but whether any transparency framework affecting children can claim legitimate authority when developed through processes that systematically excluded children from participation. A policy developed without consulting those it affects most profoundly may coincidentally align with their interests, but it cannot claim democratic legitimacy regardless of its substantive merit.

This meta-question, and the five subsidiary questions that follow, are offered here **not as definitive framing but as provisional scaffolding**—one way of organising inquiry based on existing legal frameworks, research with care-experienced adults, and rights-based analysis. They represent adults' best attempt to articulate what might matter. But they are inherently limited by the very epistemic blindness they seek to address: **we cannot know if these are the right questions without asking those whose lives are at stake**.

What follows in §7.7.3.1-7.7.3.5 presents five dimensions of the meta-question. These are offered as potential starting points for consultation, not predetermined conclusions. Children, care-experienced adults, and all other stakeholders may find these questions useful, irrelevant, or fundamentally misconceived. That uncertainty is not a weakness—it is essential recognition that question-formation itself requires the voices currently absent.

### 7.7.3.1 The Sovereignty Question

**By what authority does the state claim narrative sovereignty over children's life stories, and what mechanisms exist for children to contest or inform that authority claim?** Current policy operates on the assumption that institutional authority legitimately supersedes personal narrative control during childhood, without defending this assumption or creating mechanisms for children to challenge it. Children's Article 8 ECHR privacy rights are acknowledged but treated as interests to be "balanced" against transparency goals (McFarlane, 2024, para. 3.14), not as foundational constraints requiring children's participation before publication can occur. Yet the European Court of Human Rights has emphasised that Article 8 protects not merely privacy but "personal autonomy" and the right to "personal development" (Pretty v United Kingdom (2002) 35 EHRR 1, para. 61). Publication of judgments about children implicates these autonomy interests, yet children have no procedural mechanism to assert them in policy development or, often, in individual publication decisions. The question is not whether the current balance serves children (an empirical question), but whether any balance can claim legitimacy when struck without children's participation (a democratic question).

### 7.7.3.2 The Temporal Question

**By what authority do present decision-makers bind future selves who will experience consequences the present decision-maker cannot foresee, and what mechanisms exist to verify this authority serves the future person's concurrent interests?** If narrative rights vest with maturity, who legitimately holds them in trust during childhood, and by what standard can we verify that trust is being exercised in the child's interests rather than for institutional convenience? While the paramountcy principle (Children Act 1989, s.1) mandates that children's welfare is the court's paramount consideration in individual case decisions, transparency policy—which structures how courts assess welfare in publication contexts—developed without evidence of what children consider welfare-enhancing about publication of their cases. The Committee on the Rights of the Child has clarified that when best interests are assessed, children's interests must have "high priority" and not be "just one of several considerations" (Committee on the Rights of the Child, 2013, para. 39). Current transparency policy treats children's privacy interests as one consideration among several to be "balanced" (McFarlane, 2024, para. 3.14), yet developed this framework without establishing whether children's interests were given priority in policy design itself. The legitimacy question is not whether adults correctly assessed children's welfare, but whether adults have authority to make that assessment without consulting children about what serves their welfare in transparency contexts.

### 7.7.3.3 The Conflict Question

**When narrative interests conflict—a child's privacy versus the public's claimed interest in transparency—by what authority does the system determine priority without consulting the child whose privacy is at stake?** Current policy resolves this through judicial discretion guided by Article 8/Article 10 ECHR balancing (McFarlane, 2024, para. 3.14), but children are not parties to this balancing exercise at the policy level, and may not be consulted even in individual publication decisions if they lack legal representation. Their interests in individual cases may be represented by proxies (Cafcass, solicitors where appointed) whose institutional positions may not align with children's own preferences. Yet Article 8 jurisprudence emphasises that interference with private life must be "necessary in a democratic society" and proportionate to legitimate aims (Olsson v Sweden (1988) 11 EHRR 259). The legitimacy question is not whether the current balancing framework reaches correct results, but whether a balancing framework can claim legitimacy when developed without mechanisms for children to inform what factors should be weighed and how priorities should be determined.

### 7.7.3.4 The Permanence Question

**By what authority does anyone make irreversible narrative decisions (permanent publication) on behalf of a future self who will experience consequences the present decision-maker cannot foresee?** A judgment published when a child is 8 years old becomes part of their permanent public record, accessible when they are 18, 28, or 48. No mechanism exists for that future adult to consent to or refuse continued publication. This raises questions under Article 8 ECHR's protection of personal autonomy and identity: the European Court has recognised that "the concept of 'private life' ... covers the physical and psychological integrity of a person" and extends to aspects bearing on personal identity (Pretty v United Kingdom (2002) 35 EHRR 1, para. 61). Yet publication decisions made during childhood permanently shape the publicly available narrative of that person's identity, without mechanisms for the adult to exercise retrospective autonomy over those decisions. These questions engage fundamental issues in moral philosophy regarding consent, autonomy, and proxy decision-making. Philosophers distinguish between "precedent autonomy" (decisions made by a past self binding a future self) and "concurrent autonomy" (decisions made by one's present self) (Dworkin, 1993). Current transparency policy permits adults to exercise precedent autonomy over children's future selves—decisions made when a child is 8 bind that person at 28—without mechanisms to verify that such precedent autonomy serves the future self's concurrent autonomy interests. The legitimacy question is not whether adults correctly predicted what future adults would want, but whether adults have authority to make binding predictions without consulting children about their preferences or creating mechanisms for future adults to revisit those decisions.

### 7.7.3.5 The Epistemological Question

**By what authority does the system claim that institutional narratives are more authoritative than personal experience, and what mechanisms exist for subjects of those narratives to contest that authority?** Judgments present judicial interpretation of evidence, but care-experienced adults seeking their childhood histories often report that official records diverge from their lived experience (Selwyn et al., 2006). Publication privileges the institutional narrative as authoritative while constraining the child's ability to tell their own story on their own terms. This implicates Article 10 ECHR's protection of freedom of expression, which "constitutes one of the essential foundations of a democratic society" and applies not merely to information "that are favourably received ... but also to those that offend, shock or disturb" (Handyside v United Kingdom (1976) 1 EHRR 737, para. 49). If the published judgment becomes the authoritative narrative, children's ability to offer competing narratives is constrained by the institutional version's precedence. The legitimacy question is not whether institutional narratives are factually accurate, but whether institutions have authority to establish their narratives as authoritative without mechanisms for subjects to contest or inform those narratives.

---

**A Note on Question-Formation**

These five questions represent one way of organising inquiry into narrative authority, temporal justice, and epistemological legitimacy. They draw from legal frameworks (UNCRC, ECHR), philosophical literature on autonomy and consent, research with care-experienced adults, and developmental psychology. They are offered in good faith as potential scaffolding for consultation.

**But they may be entirely wrong.**

Children might care about completely different questions. Care-experienced adults might find this framing irrelevant to their actual concerns. Other stakeholders—parents navigating proceedings, judges making decisions, researchers analysing patterns—might identify different foundational questions that matter more.

**That possibility is not a flaw in this analysis—it is its central finding.** The very fact that we cannot know whether these questions matter without asking those affected is precisely what §7.7.4-7.7.5 document: the system was designed without mechanisms to pose questions to children, and therefore cannot know what questions would serve them.

The temporal dimension examined in §7.7.3.2 and §7.7.3.4 above is explored further in §7.7.3.6 below through the concept of the temporal cascade. §7.7.4-7.7.5 then examine why the system cannot ask these questions and document systematic exclusion across policy development. §7.7.6 opens space for children and all stakeholders to respond—not merely to these questions, but to question the questions themselves.

---

### 7.7.3.6 The Temporal Cascade: How Present Decisions Constrain Future Selves

Current transparency policy treats publication as a binary present-tense decision: publish now or seal now. Both choices have cascading temporal effects that extend decades beyond the decision point, yet neither pathway includes mechanisms for the children who become adults to participate in decisions about their own narratives.

#### Scenario 1: Publication now
- **Year 0 (age 8)**: Record becomes public without child's consent
- **Year 10 (age 18)**: Young adult discovers published judgment, cannot remove it
- **Year 20 (age 28)**: Adult defined by childhood crisis, no "right to be forgotten"

#### Scenario 2: Sealing now
- **Year 0 (age 8)**: Record sealed to protect child
- **Year 10 (age 18)**: Young adult seeking history, cannot access sealed transcript (unlike adoption records under Adoption and Children Act 2002, which grant adopted adults access to their birth records)
- **Year 20 (age 28)**: Adult wishes to authorise anonymised publication to help others, no mechanism exists

Both pathways involve adults making permanent decisions on behalf of future selves who will experience consequences the present decision-maker cannot foresee. A parent or judge determining in 2025 that a child "needs privacy and stability" makes that determination binding on the same individual in 2035, 2045, and beyond, when they may hold entirely different views about whether transparency or privacy serves their interests. The system provides no mechanism to revisit these decisions as children mature, no provision for time-limited sealing with adult review, and no recognition that the 8-year-old subject of proceedings and the 28-year-old seeking to understand their history are, developmentally and legally, different persons with potentially different preferences about transparency. Research with care-experienced adults documents this temporal disjunction: adults seeking to understand childhood proceedings report frustration at discovering published judgments they never consented to, or conversely, inability to access sealed records they wish to examine (Barn et al., 2005).

This temporal asymmetry reflects broader tensions in developmental psychology between protecting children's present welfare and respecting their future autonomy. Developmental theorists emphasise that identity formation is a lifelong process (Erikson, 1968), with adolescents and young adults actively reworking childhood narratives as part of identity consolidation (Habermas & Bluck, 2000). Permanent publication decisions made during childhood constrain this developmental process by fixing an authoritative narrative before the individual has capacity to participate in its construction.

The temporal cascade reveals a fundamental asymmetry in authority claims: adults claim authority to make permanent decisions about children's narratives, but children cannot make even temporary decisions about their own, and that authority claim persists even when children become adults. This asymmetry persists into adulthood—care-experienced adults seeking their childhood proceedings face the same barriers (judicial discretion, cost, application requirements) as any party, with no special provision recognising their unique retrospective interest in understanding the decisions that shaped their lives. The legitimacy question is not whether adults made correct predictions about what future adults would want, but whether any framework making irreversible decisions about future adults' narrative control can claim legitimacy when developed without mechanisms for those affected to participate in defining what authority the system should exercise over their life stories.

### 7.7.4 Why the System Cannot Ask This Question

The meta-question—who controls children's narratives, by what authority, and for whose benefit—is structurally excluded from institutional reform processes. Whether this exclusion occurs because asking the question would destabilise institutional interests, or for other reasons policy documents do not articulate, the effect is that foundational premises remain unexamined. If transparency policy genuinely asked "by what right do we control children's narratives?", the inquiry might conclude: "We have power to publish, but not necessarily right. Publication may be an exercise of institutional power legitimated through transparency discourse rather than a defensible claim to narrative authority over children's lives."

This conclusion would destabilise multiple institutional interests:

- **Judicial authority**: Judges' institutional power depends partly on their role as definitive narrators of legal reality. Published judgments do more than record decisions—they establish authoritative accounts of what happened, why it matters, and what it means. If children (or adults reflecting on their childhoods) can contest these narratives, judicial authority to define reality faces challenge.
- **Legal precedent systems**: Common law development requires published judgments creating binding narratives. If children's cases cannot be published, entire areas of family law lose their precedential foundation. The system's answer—"we must publish to maintain precedent"—treats legal architecture as non-negotiable and children's narrative sovereignty as expendable.
- **Professional legitimacy**: Legal professionals' expertise is demonstrated through public cases and published reasoning. Barristers build reputations on reported judgments; judges establish authority through influential decisions; academics analyze published cases. If children's narratives cannot be appropriated for these professional purposes, the demonstrable expertise of family law practitioners diminishes.
- **Reform infrastructure**: Transparency advocates require visible case examples to demonstrate systemic problems. Campaign groups, journalists, and academics rely on published judgments to evidence court failures, advocate for change, and hold institutions accountable. If children's cases are sealed, this infrastructure loses its raw material.

Institutional theorists term this "structural isomorphism": organizations adopt practices that maintain legitimacy within their institutional field, even when those practices conflict with stated goals (DiMaggio & Powell, 1983). The transparency reform process exhibits isomorphic features—consultation structures mirror existing professional networks (judges, lawyers, academics) rather than incorporating stakeholders (children) who would disrupt established patterns of authority. This is not conspiracy but organizational logic: institutions preferentially hear from actors whose participation reinforces rather than challenges existing structures (Clegg, 1989).

The Transparency Implementation Group's restricted remit demonstrates this dynamic: the subgroup could discuss how many judgments to publish and which types to prioritize, but could not examine whether publication itself serves children's interests or whether alternative transparency mechanisms might achieve systemic goals without appropriating children's narratives (Transparency Implementation Group, 2024, para. 3). This creates a self-validating loop: transparency is assumed beneficial; implementation details are debated; children's exclusion from policy debates may be rationalized as protecting them from complexity; and the resulting policy is cited as evidence of "careful consideration." At no point does the fundamental question—by what right?—enter the inquiry, because the policy framework was designed to preclude it.

The structural barriers documented above—institutional authority protection, professional monopolies, risk aversion, power preservation—explain why the meta-question and its subsidiaries have never been systematically posed to children at the policy level. The question is not whether these questions are correct, but whether a system that cannot ask them (because asking threatens institutional control) can claim to serve children's interests. The evidence below demonstrates this exclusion is not incidental but embedded across all stages of policy development.

#### 7.7.4.1 The Representation-Voice Distinction

Children in family proceedings may be represented by institutional proxies: Cafcass guardians who assess and articulate children's best interests; children's solicitors appointed in some cases under section 41 Children Act 1989; and local authority social workers who document children's circumstances and wishes. But representation in proceedings is not voice in policy development.

When transparency policy is examined through these representatives' perspectives, we learn whether Cafcass thinks publication is appropriate, whether social workers believe a case merits public attention, whether judges consider transparency serves children's interests. What remains unknown is what children themselves think about transparency, because age-appropriate consultation with children about policy questions is not routine practice. The system presumes children lack capacity to engage with transparency questions at the policy level, and often at the individual publication decision level. Despite UNCRC Article 12 granting children the right to express views in matters affecting them, when children's "wishes and feelings" appear in Cafcass reports or social services assessments about individual cases, they are paraphrased, summarized, and contextualized by professional judgment (Thomas & O'Kane, 1998). The policy-level question—"should cases like yours be published?"—is not posed to children. Even the individual-level question—"do you want this specific case made public?"—is rarely posed directly to children during crisis (domestic violence, care proceedings, parental dispute), and may be considered too complex for most children to meaningfully answer.

Sociolinguistic research demonstrates that "voice" and "representation" constitute distinct phenomena: voice involves authentic expression in one's own words and chosen medium, while representation necessarily involves translation and interpretation through another's linguistic and conceptual framework (Bakhtin, 1981). When professionals "represent" children's views in individual cases, they engage in what discourse analysts term "voicing"—animating another's perspective through their own utterance (Goffman, 1981)—which inevitably transforms the original expression through the representative's interpretive lens.

This creates an accountability void: adults decide transparency frameworks for children without systematic evidence of what children value. Current policy operates without empirical basis regarding children's actual preferences about publication policy, presuming alignment with institutional approaches—a presumption that may prioritize adult perspectives over children's own assessments of their welfare. The 2016 NYAS consultation revealed young people's distress at discovering published details of their abuse—"many felt let down" (Brophy et al., 2016, p. 19)—yet this finding did not prompt systematic consultation with children about whether publication serves their interests, either at the policy level or in routine individual publication decisions.

### 7.7.5 Evidence of Systematic Exclusion from Policy Development

The June 2024 Practice Guidance, *Transparency in the Family Courts: Publication of Judgments*, issued by Sir Andrew McFarlane, President of the Family Division (hereinafter "June 2024 Practice Guidance"), illustrates the pattern of exclusion identified above. While the President's foreword claims the guidance was "produced by a group...made up of judges, legal advisers, practitioners, CAFCASS, ADCS and young people from the FJYPB" (McFarlane, 2024, p. 1), the Publication Guidance Subgroup that actually drafted publication recommendations consisted of six legal professionals—judges, barristers, and academics—with no documented participation by FJYPB representatives acting in their capacity as representatives of young people's perspectives (Transparency Implementation Group, 2024, para. 4).

This pattern is consistent with the 2016 Brophy research consultation, where young people from NYAS were asked to review published judgments to identify anonymisation failures and distressing content, but were not consulted on whether publication itself serves children's interests or what alternative transparency mechanisms might better protect their welfare (Brophy, Perry & Harrison, 2016). Both consultations share a critical design feature: restricted scope that structurally prevents children's fundamental concerns from informing policy.

The 2024 subgroup's remit was explicitly confined to "the number of judgments that judges ought to publish" and "the types of judgments that might be deemed priority for publication," while excluding any "overview or commentary on the legal framework as it currently exists" (Transparency Implementation Group, 2024, paras. 2-3). Similarly, the 2016 consultation focused on improving anonymisation within the existing publication framework. By restricting inquiry to implementation details while forbidding examination of foundational premises, both exercises ensured that children's primary concerns—"should our cases be published at all?" and "what alternative transparency mechanisms exist?"—could not inform policy, because these questions arise at the level of analysis the inquiry was designed to exclude.

#### 7.7.5.1 Multi-Layer Exclusion Pattern

This absence compounds across all five analytical layers:

| Layer | Adult Voice Present | Children's Voice Absent | Consequence |
|-------|---------------------|-------------------------|-------------|
| **L1: Institutional Design** | MOJ/HMCTS design forms, guidance, procedures | Forms presume adult applicants; no provisions for children requesting their own records | Children cannot initiate access to transcripts of proceedings about their lives |
| **L2: Judicial Gatekeeping** | Judges apply paramountcy in individual cases, exercise discretion on publication | 2016: NYAS young people consulted on anonymisation practices but not on whether publication serves their interests; June 2024 Guidance conditions consultation on legal representation (para. 3.13); Policy framework developed outside paramountcy principle; Children's views represented in individual cases through Cafcass/solicitors but children not consulted on policy frameworks | Judges decide "in children's interests" within framework children didn't inform; even when individual children's views are represented in cases or consulted about policy, framing limits what questions they can address; children without legal representation have no mechanism to express views on publication decisions in their specific cases |
| **L3: Professional Mediation** | Solicitors/barristers navigate procedures, develop informal expertise | In individual cases, lawyers represent children's interests as interpreted by professionals; in policy development, children's perspectives are absent entirely; direct participation by children in either context remains rare | Children's preferences in individual cases filtered through professional judgment, rarely articulated directly; voice conflated with representation; no mechanisms for children's collective input into policy |
| **L4: User Experience** | Parents/litigants report barriers (costs, delays, complexity) | Children are "users" whose life histories are documented but who cannot access records | Ultimate stakeholders excluded from system designed for their benefit |
| **L5: External Observation** | Transparency Project, media, researchers monitor transparency implementation | 2016: Young people analyzed published judgments, expressed concerns about exposure; Children cannot observe proceedings about themselves; their perspectives absent from transparency debates | Policy discourse occurs entirely among adults; children's input confined to technical review; foundational policy questions remain unexamined |

The four focus groups conducted for the June 2024 Practice Guidance consulted 28 legal professionals about judicial workload and anonymisation concerns; no focus groups consulted young people (Transparency Implementation Group, 2024, paras. 9-15). This represents a regression from even the limited 2016 consultation, which at least gave young people the opportunity to express concerns about published judgments—even if those concerns were not incorporated into foundational policy review.

### 7.7.6 Opening Space: Questions as Scaffolding, Not Prescription

The preceding sections documented systematic exclusion and identified one possible meta-question with five subsidiary dimensions. But as §7.7.2 established, rushing to answers—even rushing to questions—risks embedding the same exclusionary logic that created the current system: adults identifying problems, formulating questions, and proposing solutions without consulting those whose lives are documented in the records being published.

This section does not claim to know what questions children would want us to ask. That claim would commit the epistemic error this chapter exposes. Instead, it offers hypothesized questions as scaffolding—provisional starting points based on existing research, legal frameworks, and limited past consultations—while explicitly preserving space for children and all other stakeholders to reject, modify, or replace this scaffolding entirely.

#### 7.7.6.1 The Scaffolding Approach

Research with care-experienced young people (Munro, 2001), children's rights frameworks (Lundy, 2007; UNCRC, 1989), developmental psychology literature (Howe, 2005), and the 2016 NYAS consultation findings (Brophy et al., 2016) suggest certain questions might matter to children about transparency in their case records. These research bases inform the questions below. But several caveats are essential:

1. These questions reflect adult frameworks—legal categories, philosophical concepts, policy debates—which may not align with how children actually think about privacy, publicity, and their own life stories.
2. The questions assume transparency is potentially valuable, which children might reject: "Why are you even asking about making my case public? Keep it private, full stop."
3. The questions are offered in categories (immediate impact, future self, process, systemic alternatives, harm/benefit, temporal agency) that organize adult thinking but may not reflect children's priorities.
4. Some children may find structured questions helpful; others may find them constraining. Some may want explicit scaffolding; others may want empty space to articulate concerns we haven't imagined.
5. And most critically: Children are the experts on their own experience. These questions are offered in humility, recognizing that we cannot know what matters to them until we ask—and that asking well means offering support without imposing frameworks.

With these limitations acknowledged, the questions below represent one possible starting point for consultation, not a definitive frame.

#### 7.7.6.2 Hypothesized Questions Across Six Domains

**Immediate impact questions (while they are children):**
- Who in my life will be able to identify this is about me, even with names changed?
- Will the children at my school find this? What will they think of me?
- What private information that I shared in confidence (or that my family shared) will become public?
- Does this make me "the bad kid" or "the victim kid" forever?
- Can I say no? If I can't say no, why are adults making decisions about my privacy?
- Will my parents be angry at me for what's written in the judgment?

**Future self questions (anticipating adulthood):**
- When I'm 25 and trying to move forward with my life, will this judgment be the first search result for my name?
- Did you realize this would be here forever—that future employers, partners, or my own children might find it?
- If I later understand what happened differently than the judge did, who gets to tell my story—the published judgment or me?
- Should I be able to review and consent (or refuse consent) to continued publication once I'm an adult?
- Why was my right to tell my own story on my own terms, in my own time, decided by others?

**Process questions (about rights and power):**
- Why wasn't I asked before this decision was made?
- If I object, does my objection matter, or does publication happen anyway?
- Who decided that transparency goals are more important than my privacy, and why don't I get input into that decision?
- Why am I too young to consent to publication but not too young to have my case published without consent?
- What makes you think you understand what's good for me better than I do?

**Systemic alternatives questions (about necessity):**
- Could transparency be achieved through statistics about court performance rather than publishing my specific case?
- Why is publishing individual children's stories the only transparency mechanism being pursued?
- Have you proven that publication actually improves the family court system, or is transparency an unexamined assumption?
- If you had to publish, why not restrict it to professional databases rather than the open internet?
- Could you use composite cases (combining elements from multiple cases) instead of my actual story?

**Harm and benefit questions (about justification):**
- How does publishing my case help me specifically?
- If it doesn't help me, why is it fair to use my trauma as a teaching tool for others?
- You say publication serves "the public interest"—but who decided the public's interest matters more than my privacy?
- What evidence do you have that publishing judgments makes courts work better for children?
- If you can't prove benefit and can't eliminate risk, why are you doing this?

**Temporal agency questions (about future self):**
- If you seal this now to protect me, will I be able to access it when I'm older to understand what happened?
- What if I want privacy now but want transparency later—or the reverse?
- Why do adults' 2025 predictions about what I'll need in 2035 or 2045 override my ability to decide for myself when I'm an adult?
- Shouldn't there be a mechanism to review the sealing decision when I turn 18, like there is for adoption records?
- If other adults made this record about me, shouldn't I get to decide what happens to it once I'm old enough to understand?

#### 7.7.6.3 What These Questions Cannot Capture

The questions above share limitations that consultation must address:
- They assume certain values (autonomy, privacy, future-orientation) which children might not share or prioritize differently.
- They use adult language which may not resonate with how children actually think and speak about their lives.
- They focus on transparency policy when children might want to talk about something else entirely—like why their case was in court at all, or what happened after the judgment, or whether the system helped them.
- They are questions when what children might need is not interrogation but invitation: space to share what matters to them without having to fit their concerns into our categories.

#### 7.7.6.4 The Invitation Beyond Questions

Consultation with children and care-experienced adults should therefore operate on multiple levels:
- **Level 1**: Respond to these specific questions—Do they matter? Are they wrong? Which ones actually resonate?
- **Level 2**: Propose alternative questions—What should we have asked instead? What are we missing entirely?
- **Level 3**: Challenge the framing—Should transparency even be the goal? Are we solving the wrong problem?
- **Level 4**: Offer unstructured space—"Here's what you should know about our experience that doesn't fit your questions..."

This multi-level approach recognizes that some children may find structured questions helpful while others need open space. Some may want to engage with policy details; others may want to share stories that reveal problems we never thought to ask about. Some may be ready to articulate preferences now; others may need time, support, or developmental maturity before meaningful consultation is possible.

#### 7.7.6.5 Extending the Invitation to All Stakeholders

While this section has focused on children's potential questions because their exclusion is most severe, the same principles of humility and openness apply to all six analytical layers:
- **Parents and litigants (Layer 3)**: Does our diagnosis of user experience match yours? What are we missing about what it's like to navigate this system?
- **Judges and court staff (Layer 2)**: Do the judicial gatekeeping patterns we identified reflect your experience? What constraints do you face that our analysis didn't capture?
- **Solicitors and barristers (Layer 4)**: Does the professional practice analysis ring true? What informal workarounds exist that we couldn't see?
- **Researchers and journalists (Layer 5)**: Does external observation face barriers we didn't document? What would you need to analyze patterns effectively?
- **Institutional designers (Layer 1)**: Are the design failures we identified actually fixable? What constraints make implementation harder than we assume?
- **Care-experienced adults**: Do the questions above reflect your retrospective concerns? What do you wish you'd been asked when you were the child subject of proceedings?

The analysis in Chapters 7-8 represents our best understanding based on available evidence. But it is necessarily incomplete because it was conducted without the voices of those most affected. The solutions proposed in Chapters 8-10 flow from this incomplete understanding. They may be useful starting points, partially right, or fundamentally misconceived.

That uncertainty is essential. Any framework claiming to serve children while excluding their voices lacks legitimacy, regardless of its substantive merit. The same principle applies to all stakeholders: a transparency system designed without input from those it affects cannot claim to serve them, no matter how well-intentioned.

#### 7.7.6.6 Transcripts as Future Memory: The Unique Value for Children

Transcripts hold distinctive significance for children as the only verbatim record of life-altering events. When care-experienced adults retrospectively seek their histories, they encounter judgments (judicial interpretation and reasoning—what the judge decided and why), social care files (local authority accounts, assessments, and interventions—what professionals observed and recommended), and Cafcass reports (guardian analysis of best interests—what was advocated on their behalf). But only transcripts capture what was actually said in proceedings—testimony examined, evidence challenged, arguments presented, children's own words (when given), or what was omitted about their wishes. Transcripts are the unmediated record, preserving dialogue that shaped childhood in ways judgments and reports cannot fully convey.

Yet transcripts remain systematically inaccessible even to adults seeking retrospective understanding. The 18-year-old cannot access the transcript of proceedings that determined their care order at age 8. This creates what might be termed a "reality gap": official records (judgments, social files) may diverge from memory and lived experience, yet the verbatim record that might reconcile or explain these divergences is denied. Research on care-experienced young people documents frustration with inaccessible histories—being told "it was decided in your best interests" without ability to verify what was actually considered, what their younger self said, or whether their voice was accurately represented (Neil et al., 2010). This informational asymmetry undermines trust in institutions and may deter future help-seeking, precisely opposite the system's protective intent.

Memory studies scholars emphasize the distinction between "communicative memory" (personal, biographical memory transmitted through interaction) and "cultural memory" (institutionalized, documented memory with claims to factual authority) (Assmann, 2008). Published judgments constitute cultural memory—institutionally sanctioned narratives with authoritative status. When children become adults seeking their histories, they encounter this cultural memory as authoritative, potentially displacing or contradicting their communicative memory. Yet they had no opportunity to contest or contribute to the cultural memory's construction, creating what memory theorists term "narrative foreclosure"—the premature fixing of an authoritative account before the subject can participate in its formation (Freeman, 2010).

The transcript-as-future-memory function is unique to children among system users. Adult litigants seeking transcripts typically do so for appeals (time-limited) or tactical purposes (ongoing proceedings). Children's interest is different: understanding their own history. Current transcript policy treats children's interest as identical to adults'—requiring application via EX107, judicial approval, cost payment—rather than recognizing this distinctive retrospective function.

The temporal dimension of transcript access becomes particularly acute when parents disagree about transparency. A parent arguing against publication in 2025—citing children's need for privacy and stability—makes a determination that becomes binding on those children in 2035, 2045, and beyond, when they may hold entirely different views about whether understanding their history requires access to sealed transcripts. The system provides no mechanism for children, once adult, to override parental assessments of their privacy interests made decades earlier, even though the Adoption and Children Act 2002 provides exactly such a mechanism for adopted adults seeking their birth records. This asymmetry suggests that family court transparency policy has not addressed children's status as future adults with retrospective information needs, treating them instead as perpetual subjects of parental and judicial narrative control.

Unlike adoption records, which are subject to post-18 access rights under the Adoption and Children Act 2002, family court transcripts have no analogous preserved-access mechanism. Care-experienced adults seeking to understand their histories face the same barriers as any party: application, judicial discretion, cost. The absence of evidence regarding children's actual preferences—whether some prioritize absolute privacy, some value accurate preservation even without publication, or some (particularly adolescents and care-experienced adults) might consent to anonymized publication if it prevents similar harms to others—is itself a design failure.

### 7.7.7 Beyond Diagnosis: Toward Collaborative Reconstruction

#### 7.7.7.1 What This Chapter Revealed

The five-layer analysis (Chapters 3-7) exposed a 70% visibility deficit—not as isolated failures but as systematic exclusion visible across institutional design (Layer 1), judicial gatekeeping (Layer 2), user experience (Layer 3), professional practice (Layer 4), and external observation (Layer 5). This chapter added a sixth layer: children's perspectives do not structurally inform the transparency system ostensibly designed to serve them.

But §7.7.4 revealed something deeper: this exclusion is not accidental oversight but structural feature. The system cannot know what it does not know because it was never designed to incorporate the knowledge of those it purports to serve. While the paramountcy principle (Children Act 1989, s.1) requires courts to prioritize children's welfare when deciding individual cases, and while mechanisms exist for individual children's views to be represented in proceedings through Cafcass guardians or solicitors, the policy framework that structures how those individual decisions are made developed without mechanisms for children collectively to inform what "welfare" means in transparency contexts, what risks matter to them, and what alternative mechanisms might better serve their interests.

This constitutes more than a representational gap. It reveals a legitimacy gap: decisions made "in children's best interests" without mechanisms for children to articulate those interests at the policy level, based on adult presumptions about what children need to know about their own lives.

#### 7.7.7.2 What This Chapter Cannot Provide

What this analysis cannot do—and what no adult-authored analysis can do—is answer the questions posed in §7.7.6 on children's behalf. We can identify that narrative authority questions matter. We cannot know whether children care about narrative authority, or whether they care about something else entirely that our frameworks don't capture.

We can document temporal injustice (care-experienced adults denied access to their childhood records). We cannot know whether 18+ access would serve healing, retraumatize, or prove irrelevant to what care-experienced adults actually need.

We can propose transparency reforms (Chapters 8-10) based on documented failures. We cannot know whether transparency itself is the right goal, or whether children would prefer mechanisms we haven't imagined.

This inability to know is not a weakness in this analysis—it is this analysis's central finding.

#### 7.7.7.3 The System That Wasn't There

Through this analysis, a pattern emerges: the transparency system doesn't exist as a coherent system at all. What appears in policy documents as "the transparency regime" is actually:
- Forms that contradict guidance (Layer 1)
- Judges improvising around untimed approval stages (Layer 2)
- Parents discovering barriers too late to navigate them (Layer 3)
- Solicitors developing informal workarounds (Layer 4)
- Researchers unable to detect patterns (Layer 5)
- Children excluded from informing any of it (Layer 6)

This isn't a solid structure we're dismantling. It's already fragmented, barely functioning, held together by individual adaptations and professional expertise rather than systematic design.

The question therefore is not "Should we tear down the system?" but "Should we build one? And if so, who should design it?"

#### 7.7.7.4 Two Paths Forward

The analysis in Chapters 7-8 and the paradigmatic questions in Chapter 9 lead to a fork:

**Path A: Adult-Designed Reform**  
Implement the solutions in Chapters 8-10 based on documented failures, assuming adults can determine what serves children even without their input. This path delivers improvement—transcripts in 7-14 days instead of 30-60+, publication rates of 50-80% instead of 5%, dashboard visibility instead of opacity—but it perpetuates the same exclusionary logic that created the current gap: adults identify problems, design solutions, declare success.

**Path B: Collaborative Reconstruction**  
Treat Chapters 8-10 not as solutions to implement but as working hypotheses to test. Invite all stakeholders—including children and care-experienced adults—not merely to validate proposals but to challenge them fundamentally:
- Are these the right problems?
- Are these appropriate solutions?
- Should transparency even be the goal?
- Who has authority to decide what serves children?

This path is harder. It requires surrendering the assumption that adult expertise can substitute for affected voices. It risks discovering that our entire analysis was misconceived. It opens the possibility that children might reject transparency entirely, or propose mechanisms we never considered, or reveal that the "70% gap" we diagnosed isn't the real problem at all.

But this path is the only one with legitimacy.

#### 7.7.7.5 The Collaborative Framework

This article proposes Path B through a multi-stakeholder consultation framework:  
All six analytical layers participate equally:
- Children and care-experienced adults (Layer 6)
- Parents and litigants (Layer 3)
- Judges and court staff (Layer 2)
- Solicitors and barristers (Layer 4)
- Researchers and journalists (Layer 5)
- Institutional designers (Layer 1 - HMCTS, TIG, MoJ)

Each stakeholder group can:
1. **Cross-check the diagnosis (Chapters 3-7)**:  
   - "Did we accurately describe your experience?"  
   - "What did we miss?"  
   - "Are these the right problems?"
2. **Respond to proposed solutions (Chapters 8-10)**:  
   - "Would these actually work?"  
   - "What unintended consequences might emerge?"  
   - "What alternatives might serve better?"
3. **Question the roadmap itself (Chapter 10)**:  
   - "Should transparency be the goal?"  
   - "Is the framing fundamentally wrong?"  
   - "Who has authority to decide?"
4. **Propose new directions**:  
   - "Here's what you didn't consider..."  
   - "The real problem is actually..."  
   - "What we actually need is..."

This consultation runs in parallel with implementation, not as a gate before reform begins. The documented failures in Chapters 3-7 justify immediate action on procedural fixes (Chapter 8): truth-in-forms, recording infrastructure improvements, dashboard development, approval timeline standards. These are technical corrections addressing objective failures (forms that lie, recordings that fail, timelines that don't exist) regardless of stakeholder preferences.

But the more fundamental questions—what transparency should achieve, who it should serve, whether it serves children, what mechanisms honor temporal justice—these remain open for collaborative resolution.

#### 7.7.7.6 What Success Looks Like

Success in this collaborative framework is not consensus on the solutions proposed in Chapters 8-10.  
Success is:
- **Building infrastructure where legitimate questions can be asked and answered**:  
  - Children access their records as adults (Chapter 9 §9.4) → can validate whether "child welfare" justifications were accurate  
  - Dashboard tracks patterns (Chapter 8 §8.5.1) → stakeholders can see what's actually happening  
  - Published corpus grows (Chapter 8 §8.1.12) → researchers can analyze outcomes  
  - All stakeholders have voice in ongoing refinement → system evolves based on evidence, not assumptions
- **Creating mechanisms for detecting when we're wrong**:  
  - If 18+ access reveals that sealed records harmed more than publication would have → adjust defaults  
  - If parent recording reveals systematic transcript alteration → address institutional practices  
  - If children's consultation reveals transparency harms them → question the entire premise  
  - If dashboard shows reforms aren't working → redesign
- **Honoring that the best outcome might look nothing like what this article proposes**:  
  - Children might prefer mechanisms we haven't imagined  
  - Care-experienced adults might reveal retrospective needs we didn't anticipate  
  - Judges might identify constraints that make proposals unworkable  
  - Parents might show that "solutions" create new burdens

The collaborative framework succeeds if it remains open to being fundamentally reconceived.

#### 7.7.7.7 The Invitation

This chapter began by documenting absence: children's voices systematically excluded across all five analytical layers. It ends by opening space.

**To children and care-experienced adults:**  
The questions in §7.7.6 represent our best attempt to understand what might matter to you. But we know they're limited by the very exclusion they seek to address. We offer them as scaffolding you can use, ignore, or replace entirely.  
More importantly: We cannot know what you need without asking. And we're asking.  
What do you think about records of your life being made public? What would you want us to know that our questions don't capture? What would actually help children in family court proceedings—might it be something completely different from what adults focused on transparency have assumed?  
If you were designing a system to serve children, what would it look like? And who should have the authority to decide?

**To all other stakeholders:**  
The analysis in Chapters 3-10 represents our understanding based on available evidence: case law, policy documents, user forums, FOI responses, comparative research. But it's necessarily incomplete because it was conducted without full participation from those most affected.  
We invite you to test this analysis: Does it match your experience? What did we miss? Are these the right problems? Would proposed solutions work? What alternatives might serve better?  
Most fundamentally: Should we be asking these questions at all? Is the entire framing misconceived?  
The roadmap in Chapter 10 is not a blueprint to implement—it's a hypothesis to test.  
This article supplies evidence, proposes interventions, and offers frameworks. Whether they're useful depends on whether they resonate with those who navigate, decide within, observe, and are subject to family court transparency systems.  
That determination belongs to you.

#### 7.7.7.8 What Comes Next

Chapters 8-10 proceed with proposed solutions across three tiers:
- **Procedural interventions (Chapter 8)**: Technical fixes to documented failures
- **Structural reforms (Chapter 9)**: Paradigmatic alternatives (parent recording, 18+ access, publication as governance)
- **Implementation roadmap (Chapter 10)**: Phased approach, accountability architecture, constitutional framing

These chapters are written in declarative voice—"here's what should happen"—because policy analysis requires concrete proposals. But they should be read as conditional: "If the collaborative framework confirms these directions, then here's how implementation might proceed."

The legitimacy of everything that follows depends on the consultation this chapter proposes. Without it, Chapters 8-10 represent well-intentioned adult expertise. With it, they become genuinely collaborative reconstruction.

The choice between Path A (adult-designed reform) and Path B (collaborative reconstruction) will be revealed by what happens next:  
- If Chapters 8-10 are treated as solutions to implement → **Path A**  
- If they're treated as hypotheses to test through multi-stakeholder consultation → **Path B**

This article advocates for Path B. But that choice belongs to those who will participate in reconstruction—especially those whose voices have been absent until now.

The roadmap exists. The question is: who will draw it?
