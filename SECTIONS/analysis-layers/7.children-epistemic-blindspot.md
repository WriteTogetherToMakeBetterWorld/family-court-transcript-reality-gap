### 7.7 The Absent Voice: Children as Epistemic Blind Spot Across All Five Layers

The five-layer analysis revealed interlinked and mutually reinforcing transparency barriers across institutional design (Layer 1), judicial gatekeeping (Layer 2), professional mediation (Layer 3), user experience (Layer 4), and external observation (Layer 5). Yet analysis of these layers exposed a more fundamental absence: children's perspectives do not structurally inform the transparency system ostensibly designed to serve them under the paramountcy principle. This exclusion, while demonstrated here through transparency policy, likely extends to family court reform initiatives more broadly—suggesting that a system built on the principle that children's welfare is paramount operates without mechanisms for children to guide its design.
The June 2024 Practice Guidance exemplifies this pattern: while the President's foreword claims the guidance was "produced by a group...made up of judges, legal advisers, practitioners, CAFCASS, ADCS and young people from the FJYPB" (McFarlane, 2024, p. 1), the Publication Guidance Subgroup that actually drafted publication recommendations consisted of six adult legal professionals—judges, barristers, and academics—with zero documented child participation (Transparency Implementation Group, 2024, para. 4). The subgroup's four focus groups consulted 28 legal professionals about judicial workload and anonymisation concerns; no focus groups consulted children (Transparency Implementation Group, 2024, paras. 9-15). Across all five analytical layers, institutional design incorporates no mechanisms for children's input on publication of their records; judicial reasoning invokes children's welfare without consulting children's views on transparency; professional practice represents children's interests through adult interpretation; user experience studies capture parents' voices but not children's; external observers debate transparency policy without systematic attention to children's preferences.
This constitutes epistemic blindness—the system cannot know what it does not know because it was never designed to incorporate the knowledge of those it purports to serve.

This absence compounds across layers:
- **Layer 1 (Institutional Design)**: Forms do not permit children to request transcripts of their own proceedings; EX107 presumes adult applicants
- **Layer 2 (Judicial Gatekeeping)**: Judges invoke "paramountcy of the child's welfare" (Children Act 1989) to deny publication without consulting what children value about privacy versus openness
- **Layer 3 (Professional Mediation)**: Solicitors and barristers represent children's interests as interpreted by adults; children's actual preferences remain mediated and filtered
- **Layer 4 (User Experience)**: Children are ultimate "users" of court records—their life histories are documented—yet systematically excluded from accessing those records
- **Layer 5 (External Observers)**: Children cannot observe proceedings about themselves; transparency debates occur entirely among adults

This multi-layer exclusion reveals a design failure as fundamental as any documented in preceding sections: **the system designed to protect children's welfare lacks mechanisms to ascertain what children themselves value about transparency**. The "reality gap" (§5.3)—the divergence between official records and lived experience—is nowhere more profound than for children, whose histories are preserved in transcripts they cannot access, shaped by proceedings they cannot observe, governed by transparency policies they cannot influence.

#### 7.7.1 The Representation-Voice Distinction

Children in family proceedings are represented by institutional proxies:
- **Cafcass guardians** who assess and articulate children's best interests
- **Children's solicitors** appointed in some cases under Family Procedure Rules
- **Local authority social workers** who document children's circumstances and wishes

But **representation is not voice**. When we examine transparency through these representatives' perspectives, we learn whether Cafcass thinks publication is appropriate, whether social workers believe a case merits public attention, whether judges consider transparency serves children's interests. **We never learn what children themselves think about transparency** because:

1. **Age-appropriate consultation is not routine practice**: The system presumes children lack capacity to engage with transparency questions, despite UNCRC Article 12 granting children the right to express views in matters affecting them
2. **Views are filtered through adult interpretation**: When children's "wishes and feelings" appear in Cafcass reports or social services assessments, they are paraphrased, summarized, and contextualized by professional judgment
3. **The question itself is abstracted away**: Asking "do you want this case made public?" during a crisis (domestic violence, care proceedings, parental dispute) is too abstract for most children to meaningfully answer

This creates an **accountability void**: adults decide transparency for children, citing paramountcy of welfare, without systematic evidence of what children value. Current policy is **evidence-free** regarding children's actual preferences, presuming alignment with institutional caution—a presumption that may prioritize adult comfort over child welfare.

#### 7.7.2 Institutional Proxies: Cafcass's Mediated Position

Cafcass, as primary guardian of children's interests in family proceedings, supports transparency in principle to enhance accountability and public understanding, but with stringent child-protection caveats. In their 2021 Transparency Review response, Cafcass stated:

> "We support the principle of increasing the public's understanding of the family court and how it reaches the decisions it makes."

However, they emphasized that any publication of orders or transcripts must prioritize children's experiences, wishes, and feelings, warning of potential harms:
- **Distress from media exposure**: Children recognizing their situations in public reporting
- **"Jigsaw identification"**: Details like schools, locations, or sibling arrangements enabling identification despite anonymization
- **Long-term stigmatization**: Published records following children into adulthood

The Family Justice Young People's Board, integrated into Cafcass's work, has reinforced these concerns, with young people often prioritizing privacy for "their stories" while advocating for anonymized summaries that balance openness with safety. In the 2023-2025 Transparency Pilot evaluations, Cafcass supported expanded media reporting provided anonymity protections held, but emphasized limited transcript releases to prevent retraumatization.

**Critical observation**: These are **institutional positions about what serves children**, derived from Cafcass's professional judgment and aggregated consultation with young people's boards. They represent proxy voices—valuable and expert, but not equivalent to systematic, age-appropriate consultation with children subject to specific proceedings about their own transparency preferences.

#### 7.7.3 Institutional Proxies: Social Services' Mediated Position

Social services departments, central to public law cases, echo Cafcass's dual position: supporting transparency for accountability while insisting on non-negotiable anonymity protections. The Association of Directors of Children's Services (ADCS), in submissions to the 2021 Transparency Review and subsequent pilot evaluations, highlights:

- **Accountability benefits**: Publishing anonymized outcomes could improve child protection practice and enable systemic learning from serious case reviews
- **Public trust rationale**: Openness may foster confidence in social workers' decision-making, countering media narratives of failure
- **Strict anonymity requirements**: Any publication must prevent identification, particularly in abuse or care proceedings where details could expose vulnerabilities

ADCS warns that unchecked publication might deter families from engaging with services (fearing public exposure) or stigmatize children long-term (care-experienced status becoming permanent label). These concerns informed the national rollout guidance for the 2025 transparency pilots.

**Critical observation**: Like Cafcass, social services' positions reflect **professional assessment of risk**, not direct consultation with children about their preferences. The precautionary approach—prioritize privacy unless compelling public interest demonstrated—may be appropriate, but it remains an untested adult presumption about what serves children's welfare.

#### 7.7.4 Transcripts as Future Memory: The Unique Value for Children

Transcripts hold distinctive significance for children as the only **verbatim record of life-altering events**. When care-experienced adults retrospectively seek their histories, they encounter:
- **Judgments**: Judicial interpretation and reasoning—what the judge decided and why
- **Social care files**: Local authority accounts, assessments, and interventions—what professionals observed and recommended
- **Cafcass reports**: Guardian analysis of best interests—what was advocated on their behalf

**But only transcripts capture** what was actually said in proceedings—testimony examined, evidence challenged, arguments presented, children's own words (when given), or what was omitted about their wishes. Transcripts are the **unmediated record**, preserving dialogue that shaped childhood in ways judgments and reports cannot fully convey.

Yet transcripts remain systematically inaccessible even to adults seeking retrospective understanding. **The 18-year-old cannot access the transcript of proceedings that determined their care order at age 8**. This creates a profound reality gap: official records (judgments, social files) diverge from memory and lived experience, yet the verbatim record that might reconcile or explain these divergences is denied.

Research on care-experienced young people documents frustration with inaccessible histories—being told "it was decided in your best interests" without ability to verify what was actually considered, what their younger self said, or whether their voice was accurately represented. This informational asymmetry undermines trust in institutions and may deter future help-seeking, precisely opposite the system's protective intent.

The **transcript-as-future-memory** function is unique to children among system users. Adult litigants seeking transcripts typically do so for appeals (time-limited) or tactical purposes (ongoing proceedings). Children's interest is different: **understanding their own history**. Current transcript policy treats children's interest as identical to adults'—requiring application, judicial approval, cost payment—rather than recognizing this distinctive retrospective function.

#### 7.7.5 The Research Gap and Reform Imperatives

Current transparency policy operates without empirical foundation regarding children's actual preferences. Two unanswered questions demand research:

**Question 1 (Contemporaneous)**: What would age-appropriate consultation reveal about children's views on proceedings about them?  
If children aged 10-17 in family proceedings were consulted with therapeutic support about transparency, what might they prioritize? Hypotheses from related research suggest:
- **Younger children** (10-12): Immediate privacy and stability; avoiding stigma at school or in peer groups
- **Adolescents** (13-17): Accurate records for future understanding, even if not publicly accessible; being believed and having their account preserved
- **Context-dependent preferences**: Children in domestic violence cases may fear perpetrator access to testimony; children in care proceedings may want records preserved to challenge local authority narratives

**Question 2 (Retrospective)**: Should care-experienced adults have rights to access and consent to publication of their own case transcripts?  
Unlike adoption records (subject to post-18 access rights under Adoption and Children Act 2002), family court transcripts have no analogous preserved-access mechanism. Care-experienced adults seeking to understand their histories face the same barriers as any party: application via EX107, judicial discretion, cost. Should retrospective consent enable:
- **Personal access** at age 18 (analogous to adoption records)
- **Anonymized publication consent** for systemic learning (e.g., contributing to Serious Case Review analyses, academic research on care system patterns)

**Without systematic consultation**, the system **presumes children's interests align with maximum secrecy**—a presumption that may serve institutional risk aversion more than child welfare. If children were asked (age-appropriately, with safeguards), we might discover:
- Some prioritize absolute privacy (legitimate and to be respected)
- Some value accurate preservation even without publication (transcript as future-accessible record)
- Some, particularly adolescents and care-experienced adults, might consent to anonymized publication if it prevents similar harms to others

**The absence of this evidence base** is itself a design failure. Section 8 proposes mechanisms to address this gap.

#### 7.7.6 Cross-Layer Exclusion as Systemic Failure

Children's absence from all five analytical layers compounds the reality gap documented throughout Section 7:

| Layer | Adult Voice Present | Children's Voice | Consequence |
|-------|-------------------|------------------|-------------|
| **L1: Institutional Design** | MOJ/HMCTS design forms, guidance, procedures | Forms presume adult applicants; no provisions for children requesting their own records | Children cannot initiate access to transcripts of proceedings about their lives |
| **L2: Judicial Gatekeeping** | Judges invoke paramountcy principle, exercise discretion on publication | Paramountcy applied without consulting what children value about transparency | Judges decide "in children's interests" based on adult presumptions, not child input |
| **L3: Professional Mediation** | Solicitors/barristers navigate procedures, develop informal expertise | Lawyers represent children's interests as interpreted by professionals | Children's preferences filtered through professional judgment, rarely articulated directly |
| **L4: User Experience** | Parents/litigants report barriers (costs, delays, complexity) | Children are "users" whose life histories are documented but who cannot access records | Ultimate stakeholders excluded from system designed for their benefit |
| **L5: External Observation** | TP, media, researchers monitor transparency implementation | Children cannot observe proceedings about themselves; their perspectives absent from transparency debates | Policy discourse occurs entirely among adults; children's potential views unknown |

This multi-layer exclusion reveals that **epistemic blindness about children is not incidental oversight but structural feature**. The system lacks:
- **Consultation mechanisms** for age-appropriate input on transparency preferences
- **Preserved access provisions** enabling retrospective understanding (unlike adoption records)
- **Future-consent pathways** allowing care-experienced adults to authorize anonymized publication
- **Accountability requirements** for representatives (Cafcass, social services) to document when they oppose publication "in children's interests"

These gaps are remediable through the least-resistance interventions proposed in Section 8, which embed child-centered design principles into existing reform pathways rather than requiring wholesale system transformation.
