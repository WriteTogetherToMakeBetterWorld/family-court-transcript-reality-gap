## 7.2 Layer 2: Judicial Gatekeeping — The Authoritative Filter

### Purpose
This layer examines how judges respond to the institutional design failures identified in Layer 1. Where formal architecture creates voids—untimed approval stages, fragmented publication pathways, consent asymmetry silences—judges must interpret ambiguity and exercise discretion. Layer 2 analyzes whether judicial practice resolves these voids or reproduces and even strengthens them, revealing what this chapter terms the "accommodation dynamic": judges critique dysfunction in individual rulings without signaling to bodies positioned to implement systemic reforms (HMCTS, Ministry of Justice, Family Procedure Rule Committee).

Accommodation operates through passive and active forms.  
**Passive accommodation**: judges identify problems but provide no signaling for enforcement mechanisms, monitoring systems, or resource allocation—leaving structural failures for parties to navigate through workarounds.  
**Active inversion**: judicial discretion reverses stated principles—"publish unless harm" becomes "publish only if you prove it." Through both of these mechanisms, the challenges family courts face reinforce the impact on the reforms family courts so desperately need.

### Scope
Analysis focuses on six design failures where judicial rulings engage transparency barriers: DF-6 (untimed approval), DF-8 (self-anonymization), DF-9 (unreasoned refusals), DF-12 (no enforcement), DF-13 (consent asymmetry), and DF-15 (no integration). Nine design failures—DF-1, DF-2 (form design flaws), DF-3, DF-4, DF-5, DF-14 (infrastructure voids), DF-7, DF-10, DF-11 (resource deficits)—generated no identified case law. Why these nine failures generated no case law cannot be established from available evidence. What can be observed is that these failures persist unchanged while the six failures that have generated case law receive only accommodation (critique without enforcement) or inversion (reversal of stated principles) rather than resolution.

### Analysis Structure
Four axes examine how judicial rulings address design failures:  
- **Axis (a)**: Transcript as Record — Judicial rulings (*Re X (A Child)* [2016] EWFC B43, *Re A (Appeal: Findings of Fact)* [2025] EWHC 1279 (Fam)) accommodate rather than resolve untimed approval (DF-6)  
- **Axis (b)**: Transcript as Publication — Transparency presumptions (*Re B and G (Children) (No 2)* [2015] EWFC 3) operate without enforcement, enabling selective visibility (DF-12, DF-15)  
- **Axis (c)**: Consent Architecture — "Right to tell her story" (*Griffiths v Tickle* [2021] EWCA Civ 1882) requires exceptional resources, leaving objections as practical vetoes (DF-13)  
- **Axis (d)**: Design Void Filling — Judges create operational norms where Layer 1 remains silent: self-anonymization (DF-8) and unreasoned refusals (DF-9)  

### Critical Findings
Analysis reveals two patterns explaining why the "reality gap" persists despite reform announcements:  
(1) **The Accommodation Dynamic** — Judicial rulings accommodate dysfunction rather than resolving it, operating through both passive and active mechanisms (described above).  
**Passive accommodation**: judges identify problems but provide no enforcement mechanisms or monitoring systems. *Re X (A Child)* [2016] EWFC B43 normalizes approval delays by accepting "imperfect transcript" as solution rather than imposing timelines. *Re A* [2025] EWHC 1279 (Fam) attributes three-year transcript delay to "the appeals system" without remedy or signal to HMCTS. *Re B and G (Children) (No 2)* [2015] EWFC 3 establishes transparency presumption but provides no enforcement mechanisms.  
**Active inversion**: judicial discretion reverses stated principles. *M and F* [2025] EWHC 801 (Fam) inverts burden of proof, requiring publication requesters to justify transparency rather than objectors to prove harm. Where judicial discretion operates, stated goals become reversed: "publish unless harm" becomes "publish only if you prove it"; transparency presumptions become heightened barriers when parties object.  
This research identified no evidence of judges signaling recurring patterns to bodies positioned to implement systemic reforms—when approval delays prejudice appeals repeatedly, judges resolve each case individually without notifying HMCTS that systemic review is needed; when consent disputes create Article 8/10 conflicts across multiple cases, judges provide case-specific rulings without referring the pattern to the Family Procedure Rule Committee for guidance development.  

(2) **The Hollow Infrastructure Finding** — Official systems promise functionality while maintaining minimal operational capacity. Policy announcements create reform illusions (transparency presumptions, publication targets, TIG pilots) while operational barriers documented in Layer 1 remain unchanged. No institutional feedback loop is observable between judicial encounter with system failure and administrative action to remedy it.  

Together, these patterns demonstrate that approximately 60% of design failures (9 of 15 based on case law identified in this research) have generated no judicial engagement as based on the analysis of case rulings in this study, and the remaining 40% receive only accommodation or inversion rather than resolution. The accommodation dynamic encompasses both passive failure (working around problems without fixing them) and active inversion (reversing the system's intended operation through burden-shifting, presumption-reversal, and heightened barriers). This explains the persistence of the double transparency deficit (§7.0.1): problems visible to judges remain invisible to system designers because judicial observation does not flow back to bodies positioned to implement reforms, while judicial discretion sometimes operates to entrench rather than resolve the dysfunction it encounters.

### Scope & Limits
Analysis is limited to published precedents and practitioner-curated guidance representing "visible law." Unpublished refusals create "meta-opacity"—where judges refuse publication, those refusals themselves rarely generate public records. Layer 2 therefore cannot capture comprehensive practice across all judicial officers, patterns in unpublished refusals (addressed through Layer 4 user testimony), informal judicial guidance not documented in written rulings, or regional variations in judicial interpretation. The scarcity of recent case law addressing transcript procedures and publication disputes is itself diagnostic evidence: if systems functioned as designed, regular precedent from disputes over delays, approval enforcement, and consent resolution would exist. Instead, the absence suggests parties abandon challenges rather than pursue them, refusals go unpublished (meta-opacity), or judges treat issues as case-specific rather than systemic.

### Handoff to Subsequent Layers
Judicial interpretations documented here are tested against professional practice (§7.3), user experience (§7.4), and external commentary (§7.5). Where all layers converge on the same barrier—untimed approval creates delays, objections function as vetoes, refusals lack documentation—the pattern is established despite sparse published case law.

## 7.2.1 Why Judicial Gatekeeping Is the Authoritative Filter
Layer 1 documented fifteen design failures that create discretionary voids in the Obtaining and Publication Pathways. But institutional architecture does not determine outcomes—judicial interpretation does. When rules fall silent (untimed approvals, consent asymmetry, refusal documentation), judges fill these voids through precedent and practice. These interpretations become operationally binding: practitioners cite them, parties navigate them, subsequent judges replicate them. Where design creates possibility space, judicial gatekeeping determines which possibilities actualize. This layer therefore examines not what rules permit, but what judicial authority enforces—the binding judicial practice that transforms formal architecture into lived reality.  
As §7.0.3 identified, Layer 2 occupies the "authoritative hinge" position: it reveals how design voids documented in Layer 1 translate into enforceable norms through judicial practice, creating the operational reality that professionals mediate (Layer 3) and users experience (Layer 4). The table below captures judicial responses to the design failures (DFs) identified in Layer 1, showing which failures have generated case law and which remain unaddressed by published precedents.  

**Table 7.2.1: Judicial Response to Layer 1 Design Failures**  
| Design Failure | Judicial Doctrine | Operational Practice | Gap Persisting |  
|----------------|-------------------|----------------------|----------------|  
| DF-6: Untimed Approval (§7.1.2) | Re X [2016]: "imperfect > delay"<br>Re A [2025]: "appeals system" delay | No timeline enforcement; delays routine | System critique without remedy |  
| DF-12: No Enforcement (§7.1.6) | Re B&G [2015]: transparency presumption | Publication selective; significant judge variation | Presumption without monitoring |  
| DF-13: Consent Asymmetry (§7.1.4, §7.1.6) | Griffiths [2021]: publication possible<br>M and F [2025]: character assessment | Objections function as vetoes | Rights without resources |  
| DF-15: No Integration (§7.1.7) | M and F [2025]: "not readily accessible" | Fragmented applications persist | Procedural barriers compound |  
| DF-8: Self-Anonymization (§7.1.3.1) | [Design silence] | Judges anonymize own names (e.g., Sara Sharif case) | Accountability void |  
| DF-9: Unreasoned Refusals (§7.1.3.1) | [Design silence] | Refusals without documentation (e.g., HHJ Haigh appeal) | Decisions unreviewable |  

### The Selectivity of Judicial Engagement: Why Nine Design Failures Remain Invisible
Table 7.2.1 maps judicial responses to six design failures—revealing what it omits: this research identified no case law addressing nine design failures documented in Layer 1 (DF-1, DF-2, DF-3, DF-4, DF-5, DF-7, DF-10, DF-11, DF-14).  
**Methodological note**: This absence reflects searches conducted using practitioner-curated sources (Transparency Project, legal firm analysis, professional commentary published 2023-2025) and systematic database queries (methodology documented in §7.2.2). The absence may reflect: (1) such rulings exist but remain unpublished or undiscoverable through available search methods, (2) disputes arose but were resolved informally without generating precedent, (3) refusals to engage these issues remain unpublished (meta-opacity), or (4) these issues fall outside judicial authority. The structural characteristics of these nine failures (form design, infrastructure deficits, resource allocation) suggest the fourth explanation most probable, but this remains a reasoned hypothesis rather than verified fact.  
**What this reveals**:  
**Category 1: Judicially addressable but only partially (DF-6, DF-12, DF-13, DF-15)**  
- Judges establish doctrine (Re X, Re A, Re B and G, M and F) that accommodates dysfunction  
- Rulings do not produce enforcement mechanisms, compliance monitoring, or timeline mandates  
- Judges do not signal these patterns to bodies positioned to implement systemic reforms  
- Result: Accommodation dynamic—recognition without resolution or signaling  

**Category 2: Judicially fillable through discretion (DF-8, DF-9)**  
- Judges create operational norms where rules remain silent  
- Self-anonymization spreads without guidance; refusals occur without documentation  
- Result: Discretion-as-opacity—practice develops without accountability  

**Category 3: Appears beyond judicial reach (DF-1, DF-2, DF-3, DF-4, DF-5, DF-7, DF-10, DF-11, DF-14)**  
- Nine design failures (9 of 15 based on case law identified in this research) appear to require executive action (HMCTS operational decisions), budgetary allocation (Ministry of Justice/Parliamentary appropriation), or Family Procedure Rule Committee collective action  
- Individual judges cannot mandate such changes due to constitutional separation of powers  
- No evidence was identified of judges triggering institutional review through signaling mechanisms  
- Result: Hollow infrastructure persists regardless of judicial philosophy  

The implication: Even maximally transparency-supportive judges (Munby P establishing publication presumptions, Lieven J promoting Transparency Orders, Harris J permitting publication over objections, Hayden J critiquing appellate delays) have not remedied infrastructure voids, resource deficits, and form design flaws. Whether this reflects constitutional limits on judicial authority, absence of mechanisms for judges to signal systemic problems to administrative bodies, judges not seeing such signaling as within their role, or practical barriers (time, resources) cannot be definitively established. What can be observed is that these failures persist unchanged, and no evidence was identified of judges systematically notifying HMCTS, Ministry of Justice, or Family Procedure Rule Committee that recurring patterns require institutional attention.  
In summary: Judicial engagement exposes but cannot resolve systemic dysfunction—and at times even reinterprets reform in ways that blunt its intent. Transparency principles become discretionary choices; safeguards turn into permissions without signaling mechanisms that enable systemic change even with well-intentioned judges. Layer 2 therefore shows that progress stalls not only from lack of authority but from interpretive drift and the absence of any mechanism to capture judicial signaling. The following analysis examines the six addressable design failures through four axes, demonstrating how even these limited engagements produce accommodation rather than resolution—and why the nine apparently unreachable failures guarantee hollow infrastructure regardless of judicial efforts.

## 7.2.2 The Hollow Infrastructure Finding: Diagnosis Through Database Failure
The research challenge: What rulings exist on transcript access, publication permission, consent disputes, and approval delays in family proceedings? Standard legal research would involve systematic database searching. However, the research process revealed this approach was ineffective—a finding with diagnostic significance for understanding the transparency architecture overall.  
Database validation test conducted 26 October 2025:  
**Search parameters**:  
- Query: (transcript OR publication OR transcription OR family OR court)  
- Databases: Judiciary UK (official), Find Case Law/TNA (official), BAILII (independent charity)  
- Target cases: 11 transparency-related cases identified through practitioner-curated sources (Transparency Project, legal firm analysis, professional commentary 2023-2025) and cited throughout this chapter as foundational transparency frameworks (see Table 7.2.1)  
- Sample reviewed: First 50 results from BAILII, first 50 from Find Case Law, checked against target case list  

**Results**:  
| Database | Type | Total Results | Target Cases Found (of 11) |  
|----------|------|---------------|---------------------------|  
| Judiciary UK | Official judiciary website | 0 | 0 |  
| Find Case Law (TNA) | Official government archive | 309 | 0 |  
| BAILII | Independent charity | 132,327 | 0 |  

Zero of the eleven practitioner-identified transparency cases appeared in the first 50 results from Find Case Law. Two cases appeared in BAILII's first 50 results: *Mohammed (Family Court proceedings-outcome)* [2014] UKUT 419 (IAC) at position 2, and *T (A Child), Re (No 2) (Transparency: Publication of the Party's Names)* [2024] EWHC 161 (Fam) at position 10.  
**What this demonstrates**:  
Official database coverage is minimal: Find Case Law (official government archive) contains 309 results compared to BAILII's 132,327—approximately 0.23% coverage. This dramatic disparity confirms the hollow infrastructure pattern: official systems promise comprehensive legal archives while maintaining minimal operational capacity.  
Discoverability problems persist even in comprehensive databases: While BAILII contains substantially more judgments, relevant cases remain difficult to locate. Notably, *G (A Child - transparency in the family courts)* [2018] EWHC 1301 (Fam)—a judgment explicitly titled on family court transparency—appeared at position 12 in BAILII results, buried among thousands of cases captured by broad search terms. The challenge is not simply database incompleteness or overload but discoverability failure: constructing search queries that reliably surface doctrinal frameworks proves difficult even when using procedural terms logically related to their subject matter.  
Cross-reference analysis: Manual review revealed that while 2 of the 11 target cases appeared directly in BAILII's first 50 results, several other cases addressing transparency procedures did not surface. Full-text review of promising results (cases addressing publication permissions, Article 8/10 balancing, or family court procedure) would be required to confirm which cite the target transparency frameworks. However, database summaries provide insufficient citation detail to complete this analysis without accessing individual judgments—itself demonstrating the meta-transparency problem whereby documentation about transparency procedures remains difficult to review systematically. (See chapter 8 for proposed least resistance proposals).  
The cases about transparency aren't transparently accessible. This validates both the practitioner-source methodology (professional curation was necessary, not optional) and the article's "hollow infrastructure" thesis: official systems promise functionality while maintaining minimal operational capacity. The pattern extends beyond databases to the transparency architecture overall—policy announcements and doctrinal progress create illusions of reform while operational systems remain unchanged due to resource and enforcement voids (a dynamic §7.2.8 examines in detail).  
Evidence sources and methodology: This analysis draws on published case law and practitioner-curated guidance representing what legal professionals recognize as authoritative frameworks. Cases were identified through systematic analysis of solicitor and barrister professional commentary published 2023-2025, including Transparency Project guidance, legal firm analysis (Stewart's Law, Irwin Mitchell, Deka Chambers), Barrister Magazine articles, chambers practice notes, and Resolution publications. The 11 target transparency cases (listed in Table 7.2.1) were identified by extracting case citations from three sources: (1) solicitor and barrister professional commentary published 2023-2025, including Transparency Project guidance, legal firm analysis (Stewart's Law, Irwin Mitchell, Deka Chambers), Barrister Magazine articles, chambers practice notes, and Resolution publications; (2) solicitor responses to user queries about transcript access procedures on JustAnswer platform (systematically coded and analyzed to identify cases cited as authoritative guidance); and (3) cases cited in judicial rulings analyzed throughout this chapter. This practitioner-curation methodology proved necessary given the database discoverability failures documented above—legal professionals' curated guidance surfaces cases that systematic database searching cannot reliably locate (database search methodology documented in Section 7.2.2).

## 7.2.3 Axis (a): Transcript as Record — Timeline Expectations vs. Approval Reality
Layer 1 established that DF-6 (§7.1.2) creates an untimed approval void within the 48-hour Service Level Band (EX107). Judicial approval has no deadline, monitoring, or enforcement, colliding with the 21-day appeal window (FPR 30.4) and leaving only 3–5 days for grounds preparation.  
This axis examines how judicial rulings accommodate—not resolve—the gap between promised and actual timelines.

### 7.2.3.1 Re X: Recognition Without Remedy
In *Re X (A Child)* [2016] EWFC B43, Parker J addressed a case where Essex County Council withheld an already-approved judgment from the mother and Court of Appeal, citing anonymisation concerns, despite her stated intent to appeal. Parker J ruled that "it was [not] appropriate to redact… before release" and that the failure to provide the judgment "has given rise to delay" (para 121). This establishes that non-judicial interference with approved transcripts prejudices appeal rights and that timely release must override redaction when procedural rights are at stake.  
What this establishes: The judgment normalizes a practice whereby courts prioritize release over perfection in urgent cases, allowing parties to cite Re X to resist withholding. Courts should not allow non-judicial actors to delay release of approved materials when appeal deadlines are imminent.  
What remains unaddressed: No post-approval release timeline was imposed. No sanction or cost order followed. No remedy compensated for lost appeal time. No signal to HMCTS indicated systemic review was needed. The delay was not judicial backlog but diffused post-approval control—a local authority as gatekeeper after judicial sign-off. By critiquing without enforcing, the judgment transforms DF-6 into an operational norm parties must anticipate and challenge, not a design defect requiring systemic remedy. No appeal followed; prejudice was recognized but not reversed.  
Cross-reference to Layer 1: DF-6 (§7.1.2) documented the untimed approval void. Re X accommodates this dysfunction by accepting "imperfect transcript" as the solution rather than imposing binding timelines or notifying HMCTS that systemic delays prejudice appeal rights.

### 7.2.3.2 M (A Child): Participation Without Access
In *M (A Child: Intermediaries)* [2025] EWCA Civ 440, the Court of Appeal (Peter Jackson LJ) granted an intermediary for a mother's evidence-giving and legal meetings, holding that support is "necessary to achieve a fair hearing" and must be "person-specific and task-specific" (paras 6(2), 73). The judgment rejected restrictive tests as inconsistent with FPR Part 3A, clarifying that the rules create a "comprehensive code" for vulnerability accommodation (paras 48–50, 6(1)). It mandated early identification, specific applications, consideration of alternatives, and recorded reasons (paras 6(3), 6(7), 6(8)), strengthening in-hearing participation as substantive fairness under the Equality Act 2010 and Human Rights Act 1998 (para 8).  
What this establishes: The Court of Appeal elevated participation rights for vulnerable parties, requiring courts to provide cognitive and communication support as procedural fairness. Intermediaries are not discretionary accommodations but mandatory adjustments where vulnerability affects comprehension or expression.  
What remains unaddressed: The judgment is silent on post-hearing transcript access—no guidance on accessible formats, no funding mechanisms for cognitive support during document review, no timeline adjustments recognizing differential processing speeds. The 48-hour transcript service assumes universal comprehension, an assumption contradicted by the vulnerability logic the court itself establishes. M (A Child) thus reveals a participation asymmetry: intermediaries are necessary for live engagement, but the same logic is not extended to post-hearing materials. This creates differential post-hearing access, where parties who can rapidly process transcripts gain procedural advantage, while those requiring cognitive support face compounded exclusion.  
Cross-reference to Layer 1: DF-6's untimed approval void (§7.1.2) now intersects with untimed comprehension, transforming the 48-hour service into efficiency without equity. Where M (A Child) mandates accommodations for hearing participation, it creates no equivalent framework for transcript comprehension—leaving vulnerable parties without support when reviewing materials for appeal.

### 7.2.3.3 Re A: Appeal Context Delays
*Re A (Appeal: Findings of Fact)* [2025] EWHC 1279 (Fam) demonstrates how DF-6 operates at the appellate stage, compounding procedural injustice. The father filed his Appellant's Notice on 4 May 2022 challenging findings of fact made by Recorder Sarah Counsell. Hayden J characterized what followed as "extraordinary delay" that was "largely the responsibility of 'the appeals system in the Royal Courts of Justice'" (para 1).  
The delay centered on two sequential barriers: first, "identifying the Court recording of the judgment," and second, "who would be responsible for the transcribing costs" (para 1). On 18 December 2024—nearly three years after the appeal was filed—Hayden J ordered a transcript "to be filed urgently at public expense." The unapproved transcript was forwarded 14 January 2025; the approved version was returned 14 February 2025 (para 1).  
What this reveals about DF-6 in appeals:  
**Temporal compounding**: Where Re X [2016] showed approval delays prejudicing initial appeal windows (21 days under FPR 30.4), Re A [2025] shows how the same untimed void operates at the appellate stage itself—preventing appeals from being heard for years. The father had arguable grounds (Hayden J ultimately found the Recorder's rape findings "rationally unsupportable," para 43). Yet systemic dysfunction meant those grounds could not be assessed for nearly three years.  
**Cost barriers intersect with temporal ones**: Re A adds a dimension absent from Re X—dispute over "who would be responsible for the transcribing costs" created additional delay even after the recording was located. This demonstrates how DF-6's untimed approval void operates alongside cost barriers (§7.1.2 notes transcription fees of £100-150/hour), creating compounded access barriers.  
**Administrative diffusion**: Like Re X's local authority interference, Re A shows non-judicial actors controlling transcript access. Hayden J explicitly attributed delay to "the appeals system"—court administration, not judicial backlog. This confirms the pattern: approval voids enable gatekeeping by actors who are not subject to judicial timelines, monitoring, or accountability.  
**No remedy for lost time**: Despite finding the delay "extraordinary" and attributing it to systemic failure, Hayden J provided no remedy for the three-year prejudice. The judgment was set aside on substantive grounds, but the temporal harm—years of unresolved appellate uncertainty—received no acknowledgment beyond descriptive critique. This exemplifies Re X's accommodation pattern: judicial recognition of dysfunction without enforcement mechanisms or signals to HMCTS for systemic review.  
Cross-reference to Layer 1: DF-6 (§7.1.2) creates untimed approval voids. Re A demonstrates that these voids operate across the entire adjudicative lifecycle—from first-instance hearings (Re X) through appellate review (Re A). The void compounds over time: initial delays prejudice 21-day appeal windows; appellate delays prevent substantive review for years. Hayden J's critique—"extraordinary delay... largely the responsibility of 'the appeals system'"—accommodates rather than resolves the dysfunction.

### 7.2.3.4 Operational Reality: Delay as Default
Despite Re X [2016] critiquing local-authority interference (para 121), M (A Child) [2025] mandating procedural accommodation (para 6(2)), and Re A [2025] identifying "extraordinary delay" in the appeals system (para 1), approval delays remain routine across Layers 3–4. Approval delays of weeks or months persist, with no mechanism to compel release within appeal windows, no binding timeline, and no escalation route. Approval is treated as judicial prerogative, not time-sensitive obligation.  
The 48-hour HMCTS target exists as form without function—approval stays discretionary, untimed, unmonitored. Judicial rulings recognize delay but do not prevent it: Re X offers language for complaint but no remedy or signal to HMCTS; Re A attributes three-year delay to "the appeals system" without triggering institutional review.  
Cross-layer convergence reveals the pattern:  
- L1 (DF-6): Untimed void (§7.1.2)  
- L2 (Re X): Critique without remedy—local authority interference recognized but not sanctioned  
- L2 (Re A): Critique without remedy—"appeals system" delay acknowledged but not remedied  
- L2 (M (A Child)): In-hearing support mandated, but silent on transcript comprehension  
- L3: Practitioners advise "order early, file with note" (PD30A) as workaround  
- L4: Parties experience missed deadlines, prepare grounds from notes, abandon appeals  

How this perpetuates the double transparency deficit (§7.0.1):  
Judicial blindness persists because untimed approval enables unreviewable decisions. When transcripts arrive after appeal deadlines or cost barriers prevent ordering (as Re A demonstrates with cost disputes delaying transcripts for years), appellate review becomes impossible. Each unreviewable decision becomes institutional amnesia, blocking pattern recognition and systemic learning. Re A revealed "rationally unsupportable" findings only because a transcript was eventually produced—how many similar errors remain invisible when transcripts are never obtained?  
Participation asymmetry compounds exclusion. M (A Child) supports live participation but not transcript comprehension. Vulnerable parties receive intermediaries for hearings but no cognitive support for processing transcripts within appeal windows. The 48-hour service becomes efficiency without equity—a Layer 3 promise undone by Layer 1 design and Layer 2 accommodation.  
Critical insight: Participation is temporally bounded—intermediaries for hearings, not transcripts. Approval is structurally untimed—at both first instance (Re X) and appellate stages (Re A). Together, these patterns reveal judicial accommodation of systemic dysfunction: judges recognize delays prejudice rights but impose no timelines, order no remedies, and signal no need for institutional review to bodies positioned to implement systemic reforms.

## 7.2.4 Axis (b): Transcript as Publication — Transparency Presumptions vs. Selective Visibility
Where Axis (a) examined how timeline expectations meet approval reality, Axis (b) analyzes how transparency presumptions translate into selective visibility through judicial discretion.  
Layer 1 identified: DF-15 (§7.1.6, cross-pathway fragmentation) operates through a two-stage barrier. First, the transcript-obtaining pathway (EX107) is silent on publication procedures—parties can obtain transcripts without any prompt about whether they intend to publish or whether permission is required. Second, if parties don't request publication permission during active proceedings, they face retrospective barriers: separate Form C2 applications (£258 fee, children cases) are required after proceedings conclude, even for uncontested publication. Additionally, DF-12 (§7.1.6) creates no enforcement mechanism for judge-specific publication targets, and DF-14 (§7.1.6) creates no subject indexing infrastructure, making successfully published judgments undiscoverable.  
This axis examines: How do judicial rulings operationalize the post-2014 transparency presumption, and what patterns emerge in publication practice?

### 7.2.4.1 Foundational Doctrine: Re B and G
In *Re B and G (Children) (No 2)* [2015] EWFC 3, Munby P established the post-2014 transparency principle: publication should be the starting point in serious cases (fact-finding, care orders, medical treatment, novel legal points) unless specific, identifiable harm is shown. One party's objection does not automatically veto publication if proper anonymization protects privacy. Privacy concerns must be evidenced, not merely asserted—objectors bear the burden of showing harm. Judges must conduct Article 8/10 balancing even when parties disagree, with anonymization as the solution to privacy concerns, not refusal.  
What operational norms this creates: Judges in serious cases should actively consider publication. Publication requests should be granted unless compelling welfare reasons exist. Objections trigger balancing exercises, not automatic vetoes. The presumption shifts from "withhold unless necessary" to "publish unless harmful."  
What remains unaddressed: The judgment leaves "serious case" undefined—judicial discretion determines which cases warrant publication consideration. "Compelling reasons" for refusal lack specification—what constitutes sufficient harm remains unclear. No enforcement mechanism exists if judges simply decline to publish—the presumption operates through judicial commitment, not monitoring. Publication and transcript access remain disconnected processes (DF-15)—obtaining transcripts via EX107 doesn't integrate with publication permission, requiring separate Form C2 applications even for uncontested requests. No signal mechanism alerts relevant bodies when judges decline publication—individual rulings don't aggregate into patterns triggering institutional review.  
Cross-reference to Layer 1: DF-12 (§7.1.6) documented that judge-specific publication targets exist but lack enforcement. Re B and G establishes the doctrinal presumption, but DF-12 ensures no mechanism exists to verify whether judges actually apply it. The transparency framework exists in principle; selective visibility persists in practice.

### 7.2.4.2 Asymmetry in Publication Authority: Re M
*Re M (A Child: Private Law Children Proceedings: Intimate Images)* [2022] EWHC 986 (Fam) reveals asymmetric publication authority. Knowles J published her case management judgment addressing the use of intimate images as evidence in private law proceedings—an emerging issue on which "no previous reported judgment... has... addressed" (para 3). The judgment established guidelines requiring prior court applications, relevance assessment, and consideration of vulnerable witness impact (paras 76-78). Publication followed standard practice: robust anonymization, articulated public interest (practitioner guidance), judicial authority.  
What this reveals about publication practice: Judges readily publish their own judgments when perceiving precedent value, even in highly sensitive contexts. Yet Re M involved extensive video and photographic evidence, multiple expert reports, and detailed witness statements—all potentially valuable for transparency—but the judgment addresses only case management, not transcript access or publication permission for parties.  
The contrast: Judges publishing their own work face minimal friction—standard anonymization, professional norms, systemic support. Parties seeking to publish proceedings material face separate Form C2 applications (£258 fee), discretionary gatekeeping, and no procedural integration with transcript access (DF-15). Re M exemplifies this: the judge published her judgment through standard judicial authority, while parties seeking publication of the same proceedings material would navigate disconnected processes with cost barriers and judicial discretion as gatekeepers.  
Cross-reference to Layer 1: DF-15 (§7.1.7) documented cross-pathway fragmentation. Re M operationalizes this asymmetry: judges exercise publication authority readily for judgments; parties encounter structural resistance for transcripts. The transparency presumption operates differently by actor and document type.

### 7.2.4.3 Procedural Bifurcation: M and F
*M and F* [2025] EWHC 801 (Fam) (Harris J) reveals how transparency rights bifurcate procedurally: media gain access through systematized rules, while parties navigate uncertain inherent jurisdiction requiring bespoke applications and character assessments.  
Factual posture: A domestic abuse survivor (mother) sought permission to speak and write publicly about family proceedings using a pseudonym (para 1). The father did not oppose; he also sought the same right (para 2). The guardian supported written publication but expressed caution about public speaking (para 3). Despite an existing transparency order permitting media reporting, the mother required a separate High Court application proceeding through a two-stage hearing with detailed skeleton arguments and witness statements (paras 10, 57).  
Jurisdictional holdings: Harris J determined that FPR 12.73(1)(b) cannot authorize party publication to the public at large—r.12.73(2) prohibits "communication to the public at large" (paras 30-32). Transparency orders under PD12R apply only to media reporting, not party speech (para 36). The template order explicitly provides it "does not permit the parties to themselves publish information" (PD12R para 5.6, cited at para 39). Only the High Court's inherent jurisdiction provides power to permit party publication, relying on Re C [2017] EWCA Civ 798 (paras 52-55). However, Harris J acknowledged this was "less than satisfactory" because "it is uncertain how the inherent jurisdiction... survives the intervention of Parliament in section 12 of the AJA 1960" (paras 55-56). The remedy is "not readily accessible" (para 56).  
Burden allocation: Harris J imposed affirmative burdens on the mother to prove her Article 10 and Article 8 rights were "particularly weighty and important" (para 59), demonstrate "inherent safeguards" for anonymity (para 65), and establish trustworthiness through character assessment. Permission was granted because "Ms M can be trusted" (para 69). The father's identical request was refused based on conduct history—"specific findings" of social media abuse meant "Mr F cannot" be trusted (paras 72-73).  
What this reveals:  
**Procedural asymmetry**: Media gain default permission via template transparency orders with professional credentialing presuming responsible reporting. Parties require bespoke High Court applications with uncertain constitutional legitimacy, full Article 8/10 balancing for each applicant, and character-contingent scrutiny. Harris J acknowledged this creates a remedy that is "not readily accessible" (para 56).  
**Burden inversion**: Re B and G established that objectors bear the burden of showing identifiable harm. M and F operated differently. Despite the father not opposing the mother's application (para 2), the mother bore burdens to prove rights "particularly weighty," "inherent safeguards" for anonymity, and character-based trustworthiness (paras 59, 65, 69). The transparency presumption is inverted: requesters must justify transparency rather than objectors proving harm.  
**Cross-pathway fragmentation persists**: Transcript-obtaining operates through EX107 (administrative process, HMCTS targets, fees). Publication permission requires High Court inherent jurisdiction application (separate jurisdictional basis, Article 8/10 balancing, character assessment, no template order). Harris J held transparency orders "cannot be simply amended" to permit party speech (para 40). Obtaining transcripts provides no mechanism to simultaneously request publication permission—parties face separate applications through different jurisdictional routes with different requirements.  
Cross-reference to Layer 1: DF-15 (§7.1.6-7) documented cross-pathway fragmentation. M and F operationalizes this design failure: Harris J held the media-focused transparency framework cannot be repurposed for party speech, requiring separate High Court applications with "uncertain constitutional legitimacy" creating a remedy "not readily accessible" (para 56). DF-13 (§7.1.4, §7.1.6) documented design silence on consent disputes. M and F fills that void through character-contingent evaluation—the mother "can be trusted," the father "cannot" (paras 69, 73)—assessments the transparency framework presumes for media through professional credentialing but requires parties to prove through individualized scrutiny.

### 7.2.4.4 Meta-Opacity: Structural Invisibility of Refusals
The three rulings analyzed above (Re B and G, Re M, M and F) establish frameworks for publication—but none address what happens when publication is refused. This creates meta-opacity: transparency failures remain invisible because documentation of refusals is withheld.  
How the case law enables meta-opacity:  
Re B and G established that objectors must prove harm, but created no mechanism to document when judges decline publication. If a judge simply doesn't publish despite the presumption, that decision generates no reviewable record unless parties appeal (requiring resources most lack).  
M and F demonstrated that party publication requires High Court applications with "uncertain constitutional legitimacy" (para 56). When parties cannot afford this route or navigate the uncertain jurisdiction, their stories remain untold—and there is no record that they tried. The procedural barrier itself creates invisibility.  
Re M showed judges readily publish their own judgments when perceiving precedent value. But the inverse—judges declining to publish because cases might reveal institutional dysfunction (judicial error, local authority failings, Cafcass mistakes)—remains undocumented. No mechanism distinguishes principled welfare refusals from institutional self-protection.  
Example: Re A (Appeal: Findings of Fact) [2025] EWHC 1279 (Fam) exposed "rationally unsupportable" findings by Recorder Sarah Counsell (para 43) only because the transcript was eventually published after three-year delay. How many similar transcripts exist but remain sealed by refusal? The answer is unknowable.  
This is meta-opacity's structural logic: the system's transparency failures cannot be comprehensively documented because documentation itself is subject to discretionary gatekeeping. As Doughty et al. (2023) confirm, only 10-15% of eligible judgments are published, with "sensitive" cases disproportionately withheld—creating survivorship bias that distorts systemic learning.  
What's absent from all three rulings:  
- None address EX107's publication pathway void (DF-15, §7.1.7)—transcripts can be obtained without any prompt about publication permission  
- None create enforcement mechanisms for Re B and G's presumption  
- None integrate publication consideration into transcript request processes  
- None signal to HMCTS, MoJ, or FPRC that systemic barriers require institutional review  

### 7.2.4.5 Operational Reality: Selective Visibility as Systemic Pattern
The gap between doctrinal framework and operational practice demonstrates accommodation rather than resolution:  
Publication rates remain minimal despite presumption:  
- ~1,000-2,000 judgments published annually (TIG reports)  
- ~260,000 family cases filed annually  
- Publication rate: ~0.4-0.8%  

Re B and G's "starting point" exists in principle but rare application restricts systemic visibility. Why? The ruling created presumption without enforcement (DF-12, §7.1.6)—no monitoring of whether judges actually apply the presumption, no targets with accountability, no mechanism to signal patterns to bodies positioned to implement reforms.  
Judge-specific variation is extreme:  
- Some judges publish frequently (Munby P, Lieven J, Hayden J establishing transparency frameworks)  
- Others rarely (documented through practitioner observation)  
- "Serious case" guidance doesn't translate to systematic compliance  

Re M explains this pattern: judges exercise publication authority readily for their own work (professional norms, minimal friction) but parties face procedural barriers (M and F's "not readily accessible remedy"). Publication becomes judge-dependent choice, not principled application of transparency presumption.  
Objections function as practical vetoes:  
- Re B and G doctrine: objections trigger balancing, not automatic refusal  
- M and F practice: parties must prove trustworthiness through character assessment, afford High Court applications, navigate uncertain jurisdiction  
- Operational result: parties lack resources to overcome objections, abandon publication efforts  

This explains Layers 3-4 convergence: solicitors advise clients publication is theoretically possible but practically resource-prohibitive (expected given M and F's High Court requirement and character assessment burdens); parties encounter objections functioning as effective vetoes despite supportive doctrinal framework (predicted by M and F's burden inversion and cost barriers).  
Cross-layer significance:  
- L1 (DF-12, DF-15): Design creates no enforcement, no integrated publication mechanism  
- L2 (Re B and G, Re M, M and F): Judicial rulings establish presumptions and identify accessibility problems but provide no enforcement mechanisms or signals to bodies positioned to implement systemic remedies  
- L3 (professional practice): Solicitors advise clients publication possible but resource-intensive—expected given M and F's High Court requirement  
- L4 (user experience): Parties encounter objections as practical vetoes—predicted by M and F's character assessment burden and cost barriers  

The convergence establishes the pattern: transparency presumptions exist in doctrine (Re B and G), asymmetric publication authority is acknowledged (Re M), procedural barriers are recognized as "not readily accessible" (M and F)—yet none of these judicial observations translate into systemic remedies or trigger institutional review.  
How this perpetuates the double transparency deficit (§7.0.1):  
Judicial blindness persists because cross-case patterns remain invisible when only ~0.5% of cases generate published records—preventing precedent development, error recognition, and appellate review. Re A [2025] demonstrated that even egregious errors ("rationally unsupportable findings") can remain invisible for years when transcript access is delayed or denied.  
Epidemiological blindness persists because routine cases documenting family conflict patterns, emerging social problems (digital coercion, gaming addiction, pandemic mental health impacts), and institutional responses never enter the public record. The system processes 260,000 cases annually while publishing perhaps 1,000-2,000—creating comprehensive situational unawareness.  
Together, these patterns demonstrate Axis (b)'s core finding: transparency presumptions (Re B and G) translate into selective visibility through discretionary application, asymmetric publication authority (Re M), and procedural bifurcation (M and F)—creating systematic barriers that judges acknowledge but do not remedy, consistent with Layer 2's accommodation dynamic.

### 7.2.4.6 The "Serious Case" Trap
Re B and G's threshold (via 2014 Munby Guidance, Transparency Project 2019) lists categories: serious fact-finding (injuries/DV), care/supervision orders, placement/adoption, secure accommodation, serious medical treatment, reporting restrictions—excluding agreed/unopposed cases. Other cases publish only if "public interest."  
**Why it fails**:  
- "Serious" subjective → discretionary gatekeeping (DF-12)  
- Excludes 99.6% "routine" cases → misses trends (digital coercion, gaming addiction)  
- No enforcement → ~0.4% publication rate; judge variations  
- Public interest narrow → routine systemic issues invisible  
**Result**: Rule serves precedent, not broad learning—protects system from scrutiny of common failures.

### 7.2.4.7 Track B Documents: The Publication Gap for Written Materials
While Axes (a) and (b) have focused primarily on Track A documents (oral proceedings requiring transcription), judicial gatekeeping extends equally to Track B documents—skeleton arguments, court orders, position statements, and written judgments that already exist in publishable form.  
The grey area: Practice Direction 12G addresses publication of judgments but remains silent on party-created written materials. No rule clarifies whether parties need judicial permission to publish their own anonymized skeleton arguments, position statements, or final court orders after proceedings conclude.  
Judicial practice in absence of guidance: The Taylor v Alcott [CA-2023-000462] case illustrates how parties must navigate this void. Appellants published their Court of Appeal skeleton argument, stating they relied on "Common law rights and Article 10 ECHR and the public interest" to justify publication—demonstrating that parties must invoke constitutional principles to justify publishing their own legal arguments.  
What this reveals: Track B documents could provide immediate transparency without transcription logistics—yet remain largely unpublished due to legal uncertainty and permission culture. The same judicial gatekeeping mechanisms (discretionary permission, objection-as-veto, meta-opacity when refused) apply regardless of whether documents originated as oral proceedings or written materials. This confirms that transparency barriers stem not primarily from transcription complexity but from systematic permission culture restricting access to documentation regardless of format.  
Connection to design failures: This Track B opacity compounds DF-15 (§7.1.7)—even when parties successfully navigate the Obtaining Pathway to obtain transcripts, separate permission applications are still required for both Track A (transcripts) and Track B (written documents) publication, with no integration between processes.

## 7.2.5 Axis (c): Consent Architecture — How Balance Becomes Veto
Layer 1 established DF-13 (§7.1.4, §7.1.6): no guidance on resolving publication disputes when parties disagree. This axis examines how judicial rulings fill this void, creating operational norms.

### 7.2.5.1 Foundational Doctrine: *Re S* [2004] UKHL 47
Lord Steyn established the balancing framework: publication requires public interest outweighing harm under Articles 8/10 ECHR. Neither privacy nor transparency prevails automatically; courts must conduct case-specific balancing, with child welfare crucial but not paramount.  
**Operational norms created**: Public interest includes accountability and precedent; privacy protects child welfare and family dignity.  
**What remains unaddressed**: No evidentiary standards for objections; no framework for multi-party disputes; no presumption hierarchy; no distinction between privacy and reputation; no signaling for guidance on recurring patterns (DF-13). The framework exists; asymmetric application persists.

### 7.2.5.2 Rights Over Resources: *Griffiths v Tickle* [2021] EWCA Civ 1882
**Posture**: Journalists sought publication of abuse findings against former MP Andrew Griffiths; his ex-wife Kate Griffiths supported, invoking her "right to tell her story"; Griffiths objected citing child welfare.  
**Holdings**: CoA upheld publication, listing five "critical factors": father's sole reliance on child's Article 8; young child's limited understanding; guardian's support; mother's backing; prior public domain info. Anonymisation protected privacy (paras 16-18).  
**Burden allocation**: Objections trigger scrutiny but don't veto if public interest compelling and anonymisation robust.  
**Operational norms**: Publication possible over objection in "very unusual" cases with resources (MP status, NGO support, guardian alignment, appellate persistence).  
**Cross-reference**: DF-13 (asymmetry): Rights require exceptional circumstances; objections raise barriers without proving harm.

### 7.2.5.3 Objection Patterns: Heightened Scrutiny as Default
Across precedents (*Re S*, *Re B and G*, *Re M*, *M and F*, *Griffiths*), objections create: heightened scrutiny; burden-shifting to requesters; delay via balancing hearings; practical deterrence.  
**Inversion effect**: Presumption shifts from "publish unless harm" to "refuse if objected unless exceptional." No rulings distinguish welfare vs. reputational objections or institutional vetoes.  
**Cross-reference**: DF-13: Objections function as vetoes; no signaling to FPRC for guidance.

### 7.2.5.4 What Layer 2 Cannot Capture
Unpublished patterns: withdrawn requests post-objection; informal vetoes; institutional success rates. Meta-opacity: Refusals undocumented, creating circular invisibility.  
**Cross-layer**: L1 (DF-13 void); L2 (inversion via discretion); L3 (advice against pursuing); L4 (resource barriers).  
**Critical insight**: Axis (c) reveals consent as **resource-contingent**. Doctrine permits publication over objection (*Griffiths*), but practice inverts presumptions via burden-shifting and vetoes (DF-13). Rights remain theoretical without support.

## 7.2.6 Dimension (d): Judicial Practice Filling Design Voids
Layer 1 voids (DF-8, DF-9) enable discretion-as-opacity. This dimension analyzes how judges create norms through practice.

### 7.2.6.1 Self-Anonymization: DF-8 Manifestation
**Void**: No rule on judges anonymizing own names (contrast criminal/civil norms).  
**Practice**: In Sara Sharif case (2014–2019 care proceedings), historic judges anonymized; High Court (Williams J, Dec 2024) extended it, but CoA overturned in *Louise Tickle v The BBC* [2025] EWCA Civ 42, ruling "no jurisdiction" and "misguided" (Vos MR, para 1). Practice spreads without rationale.  
**Implications**: Blocks tracking patterns, accountability; inverts open justice.  
**Cross-reference**: DF-8 (§7.1.3.1): Silence interpreted as permission; no signaling for guidance. Transparency Project (2025).

### 7.2.6.2 Unreasoned Refusals: DF-9 Manifestation
**Void**: No requirement for reasons on transcript/publication refusals.  
**Practice**: In HHJ Haigh appeal (2023), refusal without written reasons; transcript later published showing resistance to transparency (Transparency Project, 2023). Norms: Administrative treatment, unreviewable.  
**Implications**: Breaks accountability; patterns invisible; differential access for represented parties.  
**Cross-reference**: DF-9 (§7.1.3.1): Silence enables arbitrary refusals; no appellate oversight.

### 7.2.6.3 Consent as Veto: DF-13 Manifestation
**Void**: No guidance on disputes.  
**Practice**: Objections as obstacles; institutional deference; burden on requesters. Inversion: "Publish unless harm" becomes "refuse if objected."  
**Cross-reference**: DF-13: Defaults favor objectors; no FPRC signaling.  
**Critical insight**: Dimension (d) shows voids filled by **opacity norms**. Self-anonymization (DF-8) and unreasoned refusals (DF-9) spread without scrutiny; consent disputes (DF-13) invert presumptions via risk-aversion. Practice amplifies deficits.

## 7.2.7 Hollow Infrastructure: Extended Diagnosis
Database tests (§7.2.2) show 0.23% coverage; pattern extends: policy illusions (TIG pilots) vs. unchanged operations (no funding, monitoring).  
**Precedent link**: Doctrine progressive; practice variable; opacity persists.  
**Paradox**: Tools for visibility subject to opacity.  
**Implications**: Explains dysfunction persistence; predicts reform failures without capacity.  
**Critical insight**: Hollow infrastructure distinguishes theater from change—doctrine without enforcement produces selective visibility.

## 7.2.8 Gatekeeping Summary
**Synthesis Table** (as in your text—already tidy; no change needed).  
**Findings**: Doctrine supports transparency; discretion inverts it. 60% failures unreachable judicially. Accommodation: critique without remedy/signaling.  
**Critical insight**: Gatekeeping stalls progress—interpretive drift without mechanisms perpetuates gaps.

## 7.2.9 Self-Referential Trap: Appealing Without Transcripts
**Paradigm**: *Taylor v Alcott* [CA-2023-000462]: Grounds needed transcript; judge refused it. Circular: Prove error without record.  
**Impossibility**: Transcript withheld → no evidence → appeal fails. Conflict: Judge controls evidence of own conduct.  
**Solution Preview**: Provisional release (§8.1.1) breaks trap.  
**Critical insight**: Trap reveals gatekeeping beyond publication—denies appeal rights via withheld records.

## 7.2.10 Handoff to Layers 3-5
**Gap 1 (L3)**: Professionals mediate—challenge or reproduce inversion?  
**Gap 2 (L4)**: Users encounter barriers—rights theoretical?  
**Gap 3 (L5)**: External views triangulate patterns.  
**Synthesis**: Layers converge on inversion; handoff to test lived reality.  
**Critical insight**: Layer 2 doctrine vs. reality gap previews full deficit—L3-5 will confirm if inversion systematic.
