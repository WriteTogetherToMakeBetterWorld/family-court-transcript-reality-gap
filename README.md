# Family Court Reform

## Living Research Prototype

This project demonstrates [Living Research Protocol v1.0](LIVING_RESEARCH_PROTOCOL.md) - a new methodology for truth-seeking in the AI era.

**Manifesto:** Notice what's alive. Trace what you claim. Dissolve when it stops serving.

**See:** [Protocol](LIVING_RESEARCH_PROTOCOL.md)

---

> *"One transcript = more truth than 100 reporters."*

- 50,000 unresolved family cases  
- 4,000 children waiting over 2 years for a decision  
- 90% of private law cases involve domestic abuse  

**Transcripts could change that.**  
They show what really happens in court. They prove truth and let justice prevail.

## The Method

This research follows Living Research Protocol:

1. **Notice what's alive** — court silence, systemic barriers, lived pain  
2. **Materialize through co-creation** — 5 layers of evidence, AI synthesis, user feedback  
3. **Trace every claim** — all sources linked, reasoning visible  
4. **Commit with confidence** — 0.87 [0.80–0.92], sunset 2027-06-01  
5. **Dissolve when solved** — when transcript barriers removed or better analysis emerges  

**Status:** v0.9 (Nov 2025) → v1.0 (Q1 2026) → continuous evolution → dissolution TBD

## 5 Layers of Truth

Evidence triangulated across five independent perspectives:

| Layer | What It Is | Evidence Type |
|-------|-----------|---------------|
| 1. Institutional Design | HMCTS policies, official forms, guidance | Prescribed architecture |
| 2. Judicial Gatekeeping | BAILII case law, published decisions | Authoritative interpretation |
| 3. Practitioner Practice | Lawyers, solicitors, CAFCASS patterns | Professional expertise |
| 4. LEAP (Lived Experience) | Parents, families, litigants in person | User reality |
| 5. External Observers | NGOs, media, transparency advocates | Independent validation |

**Convergence = truth.** When all five layers show the same pattern, the gap is real.

## Key Findings

**15 Design Failures documented**, including:

- **DF-6: Untimed approval void** — Appeal deadlines close before transcripts approved
- **DF-1: Form-guidance disconnect** — "48-hour service" excludes weeks of processing
- **DF-7: Funding fragmentation** — Help with fees doesn't cover transcripts

**70% visibility deficit** — Most family court hearings leave no accessible record

**Result:** Judicial blindness (courts can't learn from patterns) + Epidemiological blindness (policymakers can't understand evolving conflicts)

## How to Contribute

This is living research. It evolves through contribution:

- **Report errors:** Open an [Issue](https://github.com/NoEndsNoGains/family-court-reform/issues)
- **Propose improvements:** Submit a [Pull Request](https://github.com/NoEndsNoGains/family-court-reform/pulls)
- **Share lived experience:** Use feedback forms (anonymized)
- **Challenge findings:** Red-team the analysis
- **Track implementation:** Report whether reforms actually happen

**All contributions credited in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md)**

## Sponsor the Revolution

**[$10,000/month → I garden the system. Then plant the next silo.](https://github.com/sponsors/NoEndsNoGains)**

This research requires:
- Time to maintain continuous updates
- Resources to track reform implementation  
- Capacity to synthesize new evidence
- Freedom to dissolve when the problem is solved

---

## Take Action

**If you care, do something small:**  

- **Write your MP** — [parliament.uk](https://www.parliament.uk/get-involved/contact-an-mp-or-lord/contact-your-mp/)  
- **Email the courts:** transparency@judiciary.uk  
- **Support TIG** (Transparency Implementation Group): familyjusticecouncil@judiciary.uk
- **Share this research** — Make the reality gap visible

**We don't need a revolution.**  
**We need a transcript.**  
**Transcript is a revolution.**

*This research is alive. It will evolve with evidence and dissolve when its purpose is fulfilled.*
