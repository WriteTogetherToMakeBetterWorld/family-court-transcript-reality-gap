# Family Court Transparency: We Need a Transcript

> *"One transcript = more truth than 100 reporters."*

My name is **Karolina**. I'm not a lawyer. I'm just one person who looked at the numbers.

**This is what I see:**
- 50,000 unresolved family cases
- 4,000 children waiting over 2 years for a decision
- 90% of private law cases involve domestic abuse — but courts often don't act

**Transcripts could change that.**  
They show what really happens in court. They prove abuse. They stop delays.

**Read the full report I put together:** [full-report.md](full-report.md)

**If you care, do something small:**
- **Write your MP** — find them at [parliament.uk](https://www.parliament.uk/get-involved/contact-an-mp-or-lord/contact-your-mp/)
- **Email the courts**: transparency@judiciary.uk
- **Support TIG** — the group trying to open family courts

**We don’t need a revolution. We need a transcript.**
