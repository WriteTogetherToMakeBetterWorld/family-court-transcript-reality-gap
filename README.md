# Family Court Transparency and Procedural Dysfunction

## Abstract
Family courts in England and Wales face escalating backlogs, systemic mishandling of domestic abuse, and deepening inequalities. Transparency, through verifiable templates from transcripts, offers a path to faster, safer resolutions. This article analyzes forms, user experiences, and transcription companies to answer: “We don’t need a revolution. We need a transcript.”

1. Introduction: The Crisis

* 50,000 unresolved cases (NAO 2025)

* 4,000 children wait over 2 years

* 90% of cases involve domestic abuse — yet courts fail to act (TBIJ 2025)

* Advice deserts. Digital exclusion. Trust collapse. (Nuffield 2024)

2. Transparency as Fix — Not Just Trust
Logical Gap: Courts push TIG pilots and press access — but miss the real power.
How Transcripts Solve the Problems:

“Family courts are slow because they reinvent the wheel. Transcripts are the blueprint.”

3. Transcripts = Bedrock of Transparency

* Press sees. Cannot prove.

* Judgments summarize. Do not detail.

* Transcripts = the only verifiable record.

“Transcripts are the bedrock of transparency.”\
“One transcript = more truth than 100 reporters.”

4. Lead Question
“If transcripts fix transparency, how do we boost them — without revolution?”

5. Methodology & Research Questions

* Method: Forms/guidance, user anecdotes (JustAnswer, Transparency Project), company T&Cs, FOI.

* RQs:

  1. What do forms say?

  2. What do users experience?

  3. How do companies operate?

  4. Least-resistance boosts?

6. Analysis & Least-Resistance Solutions
6.1 No Data — The Blackout

* FOI Walker 2025: No response.

* MoJ collects nothing.

“They can’t tell us how many transcripts they make. That’s not transparency. That’s a blackout.”

* Fix #1 (Easiest): Add 3 fields to CCD → quarterly CSV (<£5k, <3 months).

6.2 Forms & Procedures

* EX107: Manual, slow, no auto-trigger.

* Fix #2: Auto-tickbox + 7-day judicial approval.

6.3 User Reality

* JustAnswer: “3 months for transcript — normal.”

* Transparency Project: Neglect cases delayed by errors.

* Fix #3: Feedback portal + pro bono templates.

6.4 Transcription Companies

* MoJ-approved: VIQ, eScribers, Ubiqus

* T&Cs: “48h from audio receipt” — not from court

* Fix #4: KPIs + penalties + AI bulk deals.

7. Conclusion: The Revolution Is a Transcript

* More transcripts = more templates = faster courts.

* More templates = fewer children waiting.

* More truth = more trust.

“We don’t need a revolution. We need a transcript.”
