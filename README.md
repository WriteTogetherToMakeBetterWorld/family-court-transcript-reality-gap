# Family Court Transparency: We Need a Transcript

> *"One transcript = more truth than 100 reporters."*

My name is **Karolina**. I'm not a lawyer. I'm just one person who sees the truth.

**The family courts are in crisis:**
- 50,000 unresolved cases
- 4,000 children waiting over 2 years
- 90% involve domestic abuse — often ignored

**Transcripts are the fix.**  
They expose delays. Prove abuse. Rebuild trust.

**Read my full report:** [full-report.md](full-report.md)

**Join me — one voice can start change:**
- **Write your MP** — find yours at [parliament.uk](https://www.parliament.uk/get-involved/contact-an-mp-or-lord/contact-your-mp/)
- **Email the courts**: transparency@judiciary.uk
- **Support TIG reforms** — they’re trying to open the courts

**We don’t need a revolution. We need a transcript.**

— Karolina
