# Family Court Transparency and Procedural Dysfunction

## Abstract
Family courts face backlogs, abuse mishandling, and inequality. **Transcripts are the bedrock of transparency.** This article analyzes forms, user reality, and transcription companies to answer: **“We don’t need a revolution. We need a transcript.”**

---

## 1. Introduction: The Crisis
- **50,000 unresolved cases** (NAO 2025)  
- **4,000 children wait over 2 years**  
- **90% of cases involve domestic abuse** — yet courts fail to act (TBIJ 2025)  
- **Advice deserts. Digital exclusion. Trust collapse.** (Nuffield 2024)

---

## 2. Transparency as Fix — *Not Just Trust*
**Logical Gap**: Courts push TIG pilots and press access — but miss the real power.

**How Transcripts Solve the Problems**:
| Problem | How Transcripts Fix It |
|--------|------------------------|
| **Children wait 2+ years** | **Templates**: Past rulings → instant precedents → faster decisions |
| **Abuse mishandled** | **Verbatim proof**: Victim/child words → no misinterpretation |
| **Advice deserts** | **Free database**: Litigants search real cases |
| **Court entry** | **Prevention**: Patterns → early intervention → fewer filings |

> **“Family courts are slow because they reinvent the wheel. Transcripts are the blueprint.”**

## 3. Transcripts = Bedrock of Transparency
- Press sees. **Cannot prove.**  
- Judgments summarize. **Do not detail.**  
- **Transcripts = the only verifiable record.**

> **“Transcripts are the bedrock of transparency.”**  
> **“One transcript = more truth than 100 reporters.”**

---

## 4. Lead Question
> **“If transcripts fix transparency, how do we boost them — *without revolution*?”**

---

## 5. Methodology & Research Questions
- **Method**: Forms/guidance, user anecdotes (JustAnswer, Transparency Project), company T&Cs, FOI.  
- **RQs**:  
  1. What do forms say?  
  2. What do users experience?  
  3. How do companies operate?  
  4. **Least-resistance boosts?**

## 6. Analysis & Least-Resistance Solutions

### 6.1 No Data — The Blackout
- **FOI Walker 2025**: *No response.*  
- **MoJ collects nothing.**  
> **“They can’t tell us how many transcripts they make. That’s not transparency. That’s a blackout.”**

- **Fix #1 (Easiest)**: Add 3 fields to CCD → **quarterly CSV** (<£5k, <3 months).

---

### 6.2 Forms & Procedures
- **EX107**: Manual, slow, no auto-trigger.  
- **Fix #2**: Auto-tickbox + 7-day judicial approval.

---

### 6.3 User Reality
- **JustAnswer**: “3 months for transcript — normal.”  
- **Transparency Project**: Neglect cases delayed by errors.  
- **Fix #3**: Feedback portal + pro bono templates.

---

### 6.4 Transcription Companies
- **MoJ-approved**: VIQ, eScribers, Ubiqus  
- **T&Cs**: “48h from *audio receipt*” — **not from court**  
- **Fix #4**: KPIs + penalties + AI bulk deals.

---

## 7. Conclusion: The Revolution Is a Transcript
- **More transcripts = more templates = faster courts.**  
- **More templates = fewer children waiting.**  
- **More truth = more trust.**
