I'm sorry to read of the above circumstances. | should be very grateful if you would kindly assist
me with the following queries in the first instance.
1. May | confirm if the court provided you with the notes of the judgment when they sent you the
decision?
2. What exactly did the court say in their request for a "court transcription"? Did they specify what
aspects they need transcribed?
3. What stage is your appeal at now? &
4. Have you contacted the other party in the case to see if they obtained a transcript?
5. What is the deadline given by the judge to provide this transcription?

Many thanks for the above information. If you wish to proceed with your appeal against the order
the court has directed that you must obtain and submit a transcript of the judgment delivered at
that hearing which is a standard requirement. The order states that you must send this transcript to
the court within 14 days of service of the order.
The court has also provided a link to the official government page that explains how to obtain a
court or tribunal transcript which is quite correct.
www.gov.uk/apply-transcript-court-tribunal-hearing
You would need to apply to an authorised transcription service approved by HMCTS to request the
transcript. You will need to know the case number, the name of the judge, the date and time of the
hearing, and the court location. The application form used is EX107
https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/order-a-transcript-of-court-or-tribunal-proceedingsform-ex107
Once you have completed the application, you should submit it to the transcription company listed
in the court’s list of approved providers. There will be a charge, which varies depending on the
length of the hearing and urgency of the request. After the transcript has been produced, it should
be submitted to the court by email as directed in the order, ensuring that your claim number is
the subject line.
If the deadline for submitting the transcript has already passed as may be the case now, you may
need to write to the court without delay to explain the circumstances, such as your efforts to obtain
the transcript and any delays outside your control and ask for permission to file the transcript out of
time, ideally supported by evidence of the steps you've taken (such as contacting transcription
services). Courts do have discretion to accept late documents where there is good reason and no
significant prejudice arises, but you must act promptly and transparently to mitigate the delay.

Thank you for the question.
It is my pleasure to assist you with this today.
| have been in the UK legal profession, in high street practice, for almost 30 years, so | have a
wide range of experience and a great many different aspects of UK law and in particular, England
& Wales and some Northern Ireland.
Although | am shown as being online, | may be dealing with other people, on the telephone,
or typing.
You will receive an email when I reply.
Just Answer is not a chat service, it's an email reply board.
Sometimes it will be minutes, sometimes it may be longer, even hours or overnight.
| apologise for any delay.
I will now ask you some questions that pertain to your question — please see below.
Have you discussed this statement or the content of the negotiations with anyone else, su
lawyer or mediator?
Are there any other documents related to this case that you have received or are aware of which

What specific outcome are you hoping to achieve by responding to this statement?
Customer reply
There documents submitted are 1) her statement and supporting evidence that includes
negotiations held on a parenting app .2) Transcripts from a hearing. | have spoken to a Mckenzie
friend who has advised me just to tell my side. | am hoping to demonstrate to a deputy district
judge that in my understanding we hadn't already reached an agreement as | had not signed a
consent order that her solicitor drew up.

Is that the complete statement? The beginning appears to be missing and so does the end. It's
also very badly drafted. Has it come from solicitors?
The majority of court documents take the same format.Here is the format of a Witness Statement
https://www.justice.gov.uk/courts/procedure-rules/civil/standard-directions/general/witnessstatements
Yours would be in the same layout and format but it would be Respondent’s Reply to Applicants
Statement.
Please note that the Statement of Truth at the end of a witness statement has changed and here is
the new wording: https://parissmith.co.uk/blog/guidance-signing-statement-of-truth/
Whether it's a Witness Statement or Particulars of Claim or Defence or Reply to Defence or
whatever, the general layout and the format is the same along with the statement of truth and don’t 1 forget to sign and date it.

Double space each line and put an extra space between paragraphs.Number each paragraph
because it makes it easy for the court to refer to.| would normally not put more than 2 sentences
per paragraph.The paragraphs are for ease of reference, not to break the text up into subject
parts.
Refer to Claimant and Defendant throughout (or Petitioner/Respondent or Applicant/Respondent
as appropriate) and avoid he, she, they.Forget English-language construction.
The following is actually an extract from a recent order of the court.It’s in relation to a child matter
but the basic gist is still useful for any matter
https://formfinder.hmctsformfinder justice.gov.uk/c120-eng.pdfis the layout of the witness statement
| would suggest that in respect of every point you admit or deny or neither admit nor deny or have
any knowledge of everything that she is saying.|f you are denying something was missing it you
can then qualify the reply.
So for example you could say “it is admitted that the Parties met each other but the meeting was
on XYZ date instead of ABC date”.
“Itis denied that the Respondent attacked the Applicant but it is admitted that the Respondent did
raise his voice” that kind of thing.
At the beginning you say who you are and you say that you are using the same paragraph
Numbering as in the Applicants Statement.
Customer reply
| removed the names dates etc and the end bits. She does have solicitors
STUART J, Solicitor
I'm not bothered about the parties names. However there is no statement of truth at the end but
you may have removed that. | don't know whether there was anything in the rest of the first
paragraph which is relevant. Otherwise, my answers above remains the same.
STUART J, Solicitor

She supplied negotiations we had on a parenting app as evidence, and accused me of timewasting and wants me to pay her court fees as a result. Is there some way to make my case
without getting stuck in the weeds, as | have copious notes myself but | feel she is trying to muddy
the waters and make things more complicated than they need to be. This is the statement | sent in
at the last court ordered hearing. The judge said he would give me a chance to tell my side based
on the statement.
STUART J, Solicitor
Thank you. So you now have to reply to her statement.
Customer reply
| think you are saying | must give an answer to each point made with opposing evidence point by
point. | had hoped the fact | hadn't signed anything was enough especially given her side would
not confirm whether or not the agreement was valid - Thanks | will go back to her statement and
try and 'admit' / 'deny"
STUART J, Solicitor
It doesn't matter whether you sign anything or not. They are making the allegations and you
have to counter them. Agreements don't have to be in writing.

26/10/2025, 12:14 I'have filed in a EX107 in March but have not heard back from the employment tribunal This is for a preliminary hearing.
Generally it's good practice (though not always mandatory) to:
Inform the Respondent that you've applied for a transcript (via EX107).
Serve a copy of your application if the tribunal rules or judge required it.
To get an update on your case you can call or email the relevant Employment Tribunal where your
case was heard providing:
Your case number
Date of hearing
Date you submitted EX107
and Ask for a status update on your EX107 request.
& EX107 forms are processed by approved transcription companies (e.g. DRS, Epiq, Opus 2).
When you submitted EX107, you should have:
Chosen a transcription company
Possibly sent it to them as well as the tribunal
If you remember which company you selected, you can directly follow up with them as well.
If nothing works and you urgently need the transcript (for example, for an appeal or future
hearing), you can apply to the Tribunal for a Case Management Order under Rule 29 to:- Confirm
the status of the transcript
- Request a judge to direct the production of the hearing record.

Discussions between judges about a case are generaly not partof the nomal judical process, especially when it comes to individual heaith maters. The confidentiality of medical information is crucial, and judges are expected to make dedisions based on the evidence prosented in court. I you have reason 1o befiove
that the Masters in your two concurrent cases have discussed your medical feport and drawn inforences ‘about your health, you may have grounds to be concerned about the impartiaity of the proceedings.
A this point, your next steps could involve formally addressing this issue within the court systom. You may Want o raise the ssus with the court and express your concerns about the confidentialty of your medical information being discussed beween Mastars. You can consider making an application for one or both of the Masters o recuse themselves from your cases, ctig the potential breach of confidentiaiy and the
impact on the percepton of impartalty.
Hence, if you believe that the judges' actons have compromised the faimess of the proceedings, bringing this mater o the attention of the Judicial Conduct Investigations Offce (CIO) could also be an option. The JCIOs responsibie for handiing complaints about the personal conduct ofjudical offceholders. 1 can see the platiorm has offered you a call I you do not need one we can continue o discuss here on the chat.If you change your mind and want a cal feei free to request and we can arrange for one for you.

“The situation you're facing i indoed complex and concerning. If hearings proceeded in your absence without proper notice, particularly considering your medical crcumstances, it raises questions about famess. ‘and impartalty, which are vial standards judges should uphold. In such cases, ifs appropriate for you o raise these issues.
Regarding the judges in your case, they usually stay on unless they choose o recuse themselves or are removed by an authorty. Ifyou'e appealing one of the cases, the orginal tral judge may not be involved, as
‘appeas are often heard by differentjudges. You can request a judge's recusal f there's a perceived confict of interest or bias. This s done formally through legal processes, not pivate meetings, which coukd be inappropriate. I you belleve bias or mproper ‘conduct has significantly impacted your cases, asking for them 1o be fotied by a diferent judge is a valid opton. Suppose you tink the judges’ conduct has affected the farness of your tal. In that case, this concem can boa basis for an appeal focusing on legal grounds ke judiial bias or procedural issues.

the time this time o even apply, - with two cases going on.So anyway, ths lawyer is an intenational awyer and he's often abroad Soi's been very diffcutt pinning him down and the agreement we have is | do the aratting and he does the correcting. Which isn't great, (as Im slow) - but am trying to make him do as it s possible. Soit's nota traditional barfistericlient elationship. n the past, when Ive had pro bono lawyers, they ask me questions, ask for supporiing evidence and then they draft beautiuly - which is very helpful
bocause | overthink, and overwirite everything and that's kind of where my mental health ssues fie. | wite
for a living and writng and law are very diferent discipines and | fa allhe time by overthinking legal things ‘and over compicating them. So anyway, these adjoured hearings in my absence, fesulted in los of misinformation, and assumplions that were wrong, and the Masters afttude changed siighty afterwards, and he seemed to become very expedient. Ho wanted fo get my case over and done wih as quickly as
possible. Along with the defendant, they woukin' allow the date that my counsel was avalable just two. wesks later — and they kept saying they wanted 10 get it all sorted out beforo the summer break. S0
bocause they would not wait wo weeks, | ended up on my own again as a iigant n person and that was. Very difficult for me been having to deal with stuff on my own, when | actually HAD representation, but on dates they were not amenable o.The ofher case, which i the one I've contacted you abou - is about dishonesty and concealment as | have evidenced. The other side denied that | sent them evidence of a ‘substantial lump sum raised to dlear an alleged "shortfal’. They also denied evidence of key comespondence | had sent and that money went inio the instuucted sofiitors cient account and was meant 1o pay them. Anyway | don't wanna go into those detalls right now. But the second case is what | contacted
You about. the reason | need help s | discovered in late summer this thing about my medical evidence
being discussed between the two Masters and Im not happy about tand my dodtor is also really unhappy ‘about tAnyway, the case is a compicated and difficult one because s involves dishonesty, concealment ‘and potential perury - not easy for a someone i person o figate on her own at the best of times. But 1o have incontrovertible evidence to show there has boen dishonesty. A problem is e beon very i this year. | was very ilin May and | had a lung nfection, so the master (who | Tiked biw) gave me quite along time to
prepare my stuft. know It would be sometime after the summer break in autumn because we had discussed it at the time.Then In the summor just before the break in August | had my hearing of the first
‘case againstthe defendants strkeout and although | had very strong grounds and mert, the inevitable
happened and my case was siruck out. So I've been preparing the grounds of appeal for that, and going found and round i circles a kot ever since.And the thing that has made i worse was the discovery of the medical report that my doclor wrote and carefully prepared and which the first master referred o the other
master which suggested that they talked about , | found that reall triggering. Triggering because of the amount of losses 've sustained, because of being il and absent at several hearings and unable to defend myself Anyway, the case thatis relevant today and that | need help wit is the second case, so what happencd was that the judge was pretty good and gave me ute along time in
June when 1 was clearly il with a lung infecton and | have hospita evidence to show. | also had medical ‘evidence to back it up that | had this both lung nfection and other mental health issues ke anxiety and depression and | was on anlidepressanis. So even he was a tough judge he allowed me until autum to
prepare what was pretty crucial evidence. Histoic and otherwise However because of a number ofissues that happened: | completely missed the date of that hearing. Firsty (1) my phone was stolen in July which
had my email and passwords and | didn't get any nofifications about court dates. Secondly (2) | Had ahvays received hardcopies from the defendant as well as emals. But they stopped; so | just assumed no date boen found. (3) Sadly | was very very caught up inthis unhappiness about the discovery of this medical of
my medicalinformation being discussed and iferences being drawn, and that was all 2 ind of perfect Stom.Then again, the defendant he second matter contacted my lawyer, my counsel just hree days before. the hearing to do a drop hand agreement -which | didn't want to do. And it was only then that my lawyer mentioned to me that the hearing was on the 14th of October - which compietely shocked me as | assumed thought they were st looking forfing a date, and were yet o agree. | mmediataly appiied for reff rom Sanction for a new date, just for a short tme. | explained that there were a number ofissues indluding my
phone, being stolen, and not being able o repiace theontent of t; my healthissues, and the factthat no one had told me or contacted me from out of the court o the other side and there had been no ‘communication of any kind.The intervention of the defendant on my pro bono lawyer caused him to wak ‘away from representing me, although f I'm honest, | think itis as much to do with me, not draftng things in ‘enough time which as | saidis one of my undertying issues. But i was definel affected by the defendant contacing him three days of al the hearingSo | am now trying to put together grounds of appeal for the
Second time. And I'm back to where | started. What do | o wih this iformation about my medical report which has upsot me a Iot? it has upset me to the point almost of paralysisinthe summer, and the reason being because I'velost

When deaiing with concerns about judges discussing your medical information and possible bias, s ssentialto address this issue formally, ether in court or by fiing a complaint with the Judicial Conduct Investigations Office inthe UK. The challenges youve faced with missed court dates due 1o health issues ‘and communication problems, ke the theft of your phone, shoukd be clearly communicated o the court. s you prepare for appeais, focus on areas where you belleve there were legal errors, such as potential

Martin. Sorry 11ty again to be clearer. And {0 control my phone which seems to have a mind of s ownlAs
You stated: “The challenges you've faced with missed cout dates due o health issues and communication problems, ike the theft of your phone, shoukd be clearly communicated o the court" agree. | have done possibly too long grounds of appeal | think they re ok, but somewhat “overwritien” as usual and theyre. unperfected because they can't be properly finished unfi | have the transcript - which has st ot artivedButl neod to get a shit o and get them in asap. So s it okay 10 do shorter grounds with
‘subheadings for the time being like "Foroed oral evidence” as a heading - and something ke Instead of being granted a short extension to prepare and present evidence in witten form and despite her health issues, the opponent was forced o give oral evidence. This was both unfair and unsafistactory because she ‘could not recall everything relovant there and then, she had been afforded time originaly, recent events learly set out: had made it impossible for her o be able to present her evidence on the date ofthe hearing Efc etc."Should | send you a copy of the shortened groundsjust for you to scan them? You don' have o write them or correctthem, you can just see them. OF | can send you the longer grounds - Again just for you to'5can, 50.50 | can get an idea of whether I'm doing the right thing or not.

The.
general rule is that an appeal shall not operate as a stay of any order or decision ofthe lower cout, Whether the cour should exercise its iscretion o grant a sty wil depend upon allthe circumstances of the case, but the essential queston is "whether there is sk of injusice to on or both partis it ranis or refuses a siay". * Particular questions are as fllows: If a tay s refused what are the isks of an appeal being stlea?

1 note that the High Coutt Appeal Judge has denied your appiicaton for a tay of execution and seta Geadine of January 2, 2024, for you o fle an appeal bundie, which indludes specified documents and a transaipt of the lower court's judgment. The judge notes that if you are unabie to comply by that date, you must fomally apply for further extension before January 2, 2024. There s also mention of the possibilty of Seting aside or varying the ordor within seven days of service. Your challenge may be complicated by
missing the seven-day period, but s crucial to act prompt. In terms of your ongoing health issues, indluding your eye condition, providing relevant medical evidence could strengthen your case, especialy it impacts your abilty to handle court communications and dates.

The judge was. wrong not o allow a short adjourment due to extenuating personal circumstances, and other key factors. “The Judge erred by dismissing a number of sigrnficant factors ncluding the theft of criical nformation from the appellants phone and a lack of received communication about the hearing date, causing gentine
oversight, The judge shoud in all the circumstances, have allowed further opportunity considering the ‘appelants ircumstances, including health issues and theft of her phone, hindering her preparation.Ground 2.1t was unveasonable, technically wrong, and wrong in law fo the Learned Judge to dismiss the ‘appellants entire allegation, and case against the fourth defendant on the basis of failed personal SonviceThe judge's decision o dismiss this part of the appeliants ciaim was was wrong, and misguided
particularly given the context o the respondents own service misdemeanours. The appelant had explained that serial, egregious mis service over a number of years from the respondent had materialy prohibited the
‘appellants access to justice leading nevitably to substantiallosses. In the context of that aone, she should
ot have had her dlaim against the respondent and struck out. Particuarly as the allegations of ishonesty ‘and concealment against the fourth defendant were so serious. The appeliant dd everything with her power to make good service, including paying for a courer n Bristol, and making sure that he defvered it porsonally, and marking the envelope, ‘private and confidenta’ There was nothing more the appellant could have done in the cicumstances. To dismiss this partof a claim was both misguided and wrong in law.Ground 3. Failure of communication
“The Judge overiooked the fact tha the appellant had heard nothing ffom the cout or espondent for a
prolonged period prir o the hearing. she feceived neiher emal communication nor hard copy corespondence m. This was not considered, resulfing in a lack of clariy for the appeliant regarding her representation for the hearing date Ground 4.

Towards the end of Juy the appelant's mobi phone was stolen fom a cafe where she was working. Despie the phone being located o an address in Lewisham, the poice were unable {0 cblain a warrant o search the private property.Recovery was a time-consuming process: Recovering the lost data from the Stolen phone was a lengthy and challenging process for the appellant. She was unable to fetreve important documents, drats, notes, caselaw, and her allocated email address forthe claim due to ot having the.
passwords. Recovery s il incompete.Lack of communiation: “There was no email correspondence or hard copies sent fom either the court or the respondent for almost fve months. The appelant was unaware of the court date as there was no contact fom ether party. The respondent had been communicaing solely with the pro bono barrister assisting the appelant, without her knowledge. The appeliant had been used to receiving at the very least hardcopies by post fom both court ‘and respondent. She appreciates that the respondent may not have been ‘required' to includs herin comespondance, once in contact with her counsel, but tis easonabie to expect that important information
ke dates, should have been shared with al parties involied, and by hard copy. It would also have been wise and prudent for the fespondent to nform her that they would no longer be contacting her directy whilst ‘communicating with her counsel. But this did not happen.Ongoing ey and vision issues: The appelant has explained mulipl times of an autoimmune conditon that causes ongoing eyesight and vision problems. This condition often leads to her ‘missing detalls and affects her abiity 1o ead and see
properly when it has flared up o an excessive or uncomfortable degreeLate nofificaton from counsel: “The appelant was not aware of any fixed dates for the hearing unti a couple of days before. She had received no natification including from her barrster unt the lastfow days. They had communicated briefl,
but at ross purposes. Her counsel thought she was aware and did not mention the date untia couple of
days before. The appellant i turn, assumed it had not yet been fixed because it had not been referred to by counsal; whowas largely discussing recent contract made by the respondent. She was deeply shocked to then ind out ha the hearing was just days away. She may have boen copied i or tod earlier on, butfor whatever reason it had not ‘registered on her. She just believed that there was a date that nesded o be frmed up past Septomber 2023, This miscommunication: - one of the documented issues the appellant has
referred 1o when discussing CPR 1A - led the appeliant to believe thatthe date had notyet boen
fxedInvolvement n another urgent matter: “The appelant was simutaneously deeply immersed in another matter that required her full attention, and. that had disclosed dificut information that had affected her abily o ligate. Without a fixed date for the. hearing, she priorfised condluding the other mater first,
(Contnued). Seriousness Of Case. Moreover on the seriousness and gravity of the allegations of ishonesty and concealment alone, and within the case fsef, - the learned Judge should have allowed a short extension of time. There was no
timetable, no tralor speific dates that the appellants oversight affected. It did not cause prejudice o the respondent. And the appellant should not have be deprived of an opportuniy 1o progress such an mportant ‘caseThess circumstances, when considered together, were an unusual and regretiable, perfoct storn’ ~
that significanty impacted the appelants abilty to prepare adequately for the hearing. Her reasons were
genuine, regretiable,and based on a series of events that culminated in the missed hearing date. The. judge's failure o recognise and evaluate these factors constituted an erforof law and fed o the procedural imegularity and ulimately an unfair ral in the appelants case.

Social workers in. They have also came with the police in 16th june and police forced the door, the poiice ‘came in and found my toddler sleeping and my oldest with his riend i the oom. This was whi we was in process of doing mediation and i asked themin the etfer before ciaim to not come to my property unti a decision is made Now i have 30 min to think while in jucicial review proceedings, i alow them to conduct an assessment
where there willbe risks they will e again , and if dont they will refe t o the service manager or debuty director. And i dont know what 1o do, especiall that by monday i need to submit a full court bundie with all
the evidence, which with them stil coming to my door and caling and my health ssues, they dont allow me. the time to fully prepare the documents forthe court
Lawyer: JD Law
Judicial Review Case: + Focus on your court bundle: Its crucia to prioiize your judicalreview bundle due on Monday. Gather all
‘evidence disproving the accusations, including medical records for your hypertension, proof the house is
sutable (pictures, receipls), and any communication showing you sought help for the mental health criss. + Limited role ofthe court: Courts generally won't give legal advioe, but they can dary deadines and
procedures. It might be helpful o call the court again and expiain the urgency of your stuation, equesting clarfication on what must be included i the inial bundle and i there's a process to submit addiional evidence latr. Socal Senvices Vists: + Right o refuse enlry: You have the right o refuse socialservices entry o your home unless they have a
court rder. Explain youre preparing a judicil review and would prefer communication to happen through
your writen response inthe court bundie + Understanding their perspective: Whil thei porsistenco might feo! Iike pressure, social senices have a
legal duty o safeguard chidren. Expressing your willngness to cooperate (trough the court process) might help manage the situaton.
Next Steps: 1. Prioritize your court bundle: Focus on gathering evidence to disprove the accusations. 2. Contact the cout for darfication: Expiain your stuation and ask for any flexibilty regarding the intal
bundie and submiting addiional evidence later
1. Manage social services vists: Poltely but fimly refuse entry 0 your home, explain you'e preparing a
judicial review, and prefer writien communication through the court Remember, tis s a complex situation. Whil this advice provides a starting point, consulting with a lawyer specializing in judicial review and chid protection cases is highly recommended. They can give you tikored
guidance based on the specifcs of your case. Do you require any carification on the above?

what exacty should | ask them to cooperate through the court and also should i refuse the assessment and ‘explain that i need 1o focus on the judicialreview case that s related etc? Thank you
Lawyer: JD Law
I your case, you can seek cooperation from Social Setvices through the court in two key ways. Firsl, you can request speciic documentsn your court bundle, such as previous assessments, police reporls, and ‘communication with other professionals. This wil provide necessary information for addressing accusations in your judicial review. Second, you can ask for an adjourment of the assessment due 1o health reasons ‘and focus on preparing forthe judicial review. Poliely deine the assessment, explain your situation, and
suggest alternative ways to cooperate. Remember to be respectul but assertive in your refusal, priortzing
the court process and your welkbeing. Do you require any clarification on the above?

Lawyer: JD Law
“Their responses serve as a valuable foundation for bulding your case fo the judicial feview. Here's a ‘summary of their answers and how you can leverage them:Key Points to Strengthen Your Case: 1. Cannabis Allegation: Their nabilty o confirm the source or any invesiigation weakens their rationale for
the Child Protection Plan (CPP) 2. Police Entry: They shift responsibilty to the police. Consider requesting disciosure of relevant police records from the June 16ih incident. Your "Leter Before Claim” reflects your atiempt o resolve the stuation through legal channels.
3. Justiication for Inervention: They emphasize theirduty to safequard chikren. You can challenge ths by arguing that their actions, such as forced entry and repeated vsits, caused undue stress that could hamn
Your chidren's wel-being. 4. Biological Father Misiformation: Acknowledgement of the erfor and commitment o update the record
highlights potentialinaccuracies in ther report. 5. Objectivy: Their response lacks specific examples, raising doubls about the impartiaty o their ‘assessments. Additonal Points for the Court Bundie: - Include copies of your correspondence requesting information and their esponses. - Ifyou have medical records documenting your health issues, consider ncluding them with necessary
privacy redactions. - Include any evidence that contradics thefrclaims, such as feceipts for home improvements.Focus on the.
Judicial Review:
Whie these responses offe valuable insights, prioritize completing your court bundie for the judiial reviow. ‘Concentrate on disproving the accusations and demonsirating that the CPP was implemented without
proper justiication. Is there anyihing specific you need assistance with as you prepare for the judicil review?

Hello Lea.
My name is’ need to appeal against a decision of East London Family court's order regarding
the custody of my children. | need to know the process of appeal. | used to be on Legal Aid, |
discharged my lawyer, they did not represent me well. This legal battle lasts already for 2.5 years.
The Court took CAFCASS recommendation. CAFCASS officer took my ex-husband viewpoint and
disregarded my children's wishes. My children went to GP to seek reconciliation with me, the GP
confirmed that.

26/10/2025, 11:56 I need to appeal a court decision re children custody. | also suffered domestic abuse
What was the order made?
Customer reply
Hi Lea,
The order is not made yet. On the hearing the judge said she will issue a variation order, meaning
she will take the last order and vary it a little. The last order was that | can see children in contact
centre with supervision. Now the judge allowed the contact to move into "community" supervised
by a person agreed by both parents. | wanted 100% custody based on my children visited the GP
asking to help with reconciliation. This is major development, until that the father told to the court
that children dont want to see me. So, the father (resident parent and my ex-husband) lied to the
court
SASH_LAW, Lawyer
An order is made at the hearing - so the judge has already decided to vary the order and give the
father contact in the community, is that correct?
Is that what you are wanting to appeal?
Customer reply
Hi Lea,
The order was made against me. My ex was a lawyer in the past and he knew how to act. So, he
put a NMO against me while | was in hospital. So, | try to dispute the order for the last 2.5 years

And that is what you wish to appeal?
Customer reply
correct
SASH_LAW, Lawyer
You can only appeal an order if the judge made an error of fact, law or procedure. You don't
appear to be saying the judge made an error of one of these things, but if you think he/she did,
then what you need to do to appeal is set out below.
To appeal you need form N161, and you will be required to order a transcript of the hearing you
are appealing, produce your grounds of appeal (what errors of fact, law or procedure the judge
made), and a skeleton argument detailing the law that you are seeking to rely on to support the
grounds of appeal.
Appealing is difficult and it is very likely you will need a solicitor to go over the transcript for you
to see if there are in fact grounds to appeal the decision. Be aware that if you lose, you may be
asked to pay the other side’s costs.
You can find a solicitor here: solicitors.lawsociety.org.uk
You will need form EX107 to obtain the transcript, and the notes to help you complete that form.

Lea,
While being married, | suffered a domestic abuse which | was not aware of before. My ex-husband
was abusing me heating me in the head. | did not recall most of it until | started to write witness
statement and had gaps in my memory. | went to GP with a stiff neck and the GP said that | have a
"dowager hump", which is an evidence of domestic abuse. How can | use it to fight for my
children?
On the last hearing | provided the GP statement to the court. But the judge did not pursue it.
Can you suggest how can | use this to fight for my children

Good evening and thank you for your question. I'm a partner in a law firm specialising in family law
and dispute resolution so I'd be happy to offer some guidance on this matter.
I'll need a little more information to fully answer your question.

any personal info.
Secondly, what was drafted incorrectly? Have you signed the order?

Hello again. Were these dates actually discussed in court? Were you not sent a copy of the draft
order before it was filed with the court?
Customer reply
Neither of us were represented so the legal advisor in the hearing wrote the order and posted it to
us. Xmas dates were never an issue only new years. The times are right, just should be until
Boxing Day at 18.00 not Xmas day.
This is the only copy we are sent
Was heard by the magistrates
JEREMYT1020, Solicitor
In the first instance, you need to write to the other side's solicitor and reiterate your dates. If they
are not willing to agree to the amended times/days, you may have to appeal. As it was a
magistrates' court that heard the matter, you cannot obtain a transcript as the hearings in
magistrates' courts are never recorded.
If you appeal the order, please bear in mind there is a strict time limit of 21 days to lodge your
appeal. If the other side are unco-operative over changing the date voluntarily, you will probably
have to threaten them with the appeal.
Customer reply
Thank you for your reply.l was under the impression that the family court hearings were recorded
no matter what court they were heard in so | now believe I'm stuck.
My ex is very controlling but has flipped it on me to make out | am. He is still refusing to
communicate even though the judge ordered him to. | have asked him to agree the dates are
wrong but | am getting ignored as usual. He doesn’t have a solicitor.
It has always been that he has all of xmas eve and me xmas day and boxing day as he doesn’t
celebrate xmas day. Obviously he now won't agree to change this as he knows it is upsetting for
me.The order was made on 21st May and | received the order 2 weeks ago. | have been writing to
the court regarding this and what | have to do to get it amended but also no reply.
| don't think | can appeal now | am banned.
Customer reply
What form will | need to lodge an appeal? | am only appealing as the order is different to what was
agreed in court. This is a mistake in the wording. It's not that | didn’t agree to what the judge
agreed in court. 1

i \vill still have to consider your appeal even if there is a section 91 in place. This is
because, whilst a section 91 is meant to prevent 'frivolous' applications, to blanket ban a genuine

26/10/2025, 12:01 I'was in family court for a directions hearing yesterday after a S7 report recommended a Fact Finding and no interim
Judge said that because it will be a 4 day FFH that it will likely be next summer so set up contact in
the interim.. against CAFCASS recommendation. | feel CAFCASS took all this into consideration
and against mine and Dad's suggestions of supervised, recommended no interim. Having read the
S7 and how significant the abuse would have been even at their young age, | agree with
CAFCASS that not even Supervised is safe.
SASH_LAW, Family Lawyer
Did the judge order the supervised contact without your agreement?
SASH_LAW, Family Lawyer
That's quite an unusual stance to take.
Did the judge fully explain their reasons for going against cafcass' recommendations?
Customer reply
They commented that in the S7 interview | agreed to supervised.. but a lot more has happened
since and his lies are very concerning
Just said it was because of the time frame. But | believe that CAFCASS knew this as even to me
said it would be a considerable length of time.
SASH_LAW, Family Lawyer
Are you concerned that the father will be directly abusive to the child?
Customer reply
| believe that the Supervised helps negate that part of the abuse, but not other aspects. And not
against the rest of the family. He is destroying me emotionally and I'm barely hanging on, this will
be too much. Their siblings cried, Dad has a son from another relationship who was planning on
refusing contact if he didn't get contact with my child as they don't want anything to do with Dad,
but had said they will keep going to protect toddler ifiwhen unsupervised is granted.

26/10/2025, 12:01 I'was in family court for a directions hearing yesterday after a S7 report recommended a Fact Finding and no interim
Is your question today then, whether or not you may have grounds for appeal?
Customer reply
how to go about it. Indirect is for 6 weeks (3x cards) then direct contact, so not sure how much
time | have.
SASH_LAW, Family Lawyer
What level of judge made the order - a district judge or a circuit judge?
Customer reply
| don't know. It was in County court
SASH_LAW, Family Lawyer
You can only appeal an order if the judge made an error of fact, law or procedure. You must
appeal an interim judgment within 7 days. If you are late, or out of time to appeal, you must
apply for permission to appeal, which you do on the same form as your substantive appeal.
An appeal from magistrates or district judge goes to the circuit judge at the same court.
To appeal you need form N161, and you will be required to order a transcript of the hearing you
are appealing, produce your grounds of appeal (what errors of fact, law or procedure the judge
made), and a skeleton argument detailing the law that you are seeking to rely on to support the
grounds of appeal.
Appealing is difficult and it is very likely you will need a solicitor to go over the transcript for you
to see if there are in fact grounds to appeal the decision. Be aware that if you lose, you may be
asked to pay the other side’s costs.
Form N161 and notes to help you complete it are here:

Focus on getting the appeal application in first so you don't miss the deadline - and then add
the other info (transcript, order etc., once you receive them).
Customer reply
| have Legal aid, but assume they wont support this appeal
What costs will the other side have? Do you mean if this does go back to court? They are self
representing.
SASH_LAW, Family Lawyer
Yes, legal fees.
If self representing, then they may not have legal fees - but for an appeal, lots of people instruct
a lawyer.
Legal Aid will only support an appeal if they are sure you have a good chance of success.
Customer reply
Hmm he might just to occur costs...
My solicitor a very lack lustre, so don't think they would support anything
SASH_LAW, Family Lawyer
It's more about whether there are actual grounds to appeal or not. If the judge made an interim
order regarding contact whilst ignoring cafcass recommendations, they would have to fully
explain that - if they did not, then that may be grounds for appeal as it would be an error.
But | am going by what you have said - your solicitor, or whoever represented you in court, will
be the one who can tell you if there was in fact an error made that is worthwhile appealing on.

SASH_LAW, Family Lawyer
Yes, as | said, it looks like there is at least one ground - but only your solicitor can determine
that as they have all the facts from the hearing.
Customer reply
Which they wont talk to me about if LA don't cover it... so what do | do if they won't help me but are
the only people who can?
SASH_LAW, Family Lawyer
They will talk to you about whether you have grounds for appeal - LAA won't be involved until
they say yes or no...if your solicitors say there are no grounds, or no prospect of success, you'll
need to fund an appeal yourself if you wish to go down that route.

3. How does not having a transcript of the hearing put you at a severe disadvantage in your

Customer reply
It is my intention to complain formally about the the inability to obtain a recording and therefore a
transcript. It defies logic and fairness that complaining won't do any good but thanks for letting me
know that you believe it wouldn't. Unfortunately handwritten notes can not be backed with
evidence - for example the judge at the hearing was contacted 3 days prior to the hearing by me to
explain that | hadn't received the claimant's bundle. The judge stated at the hearing that he had
received my email but had decided to proceed only to later clearly demonstrate that he had clearly
not read the email as he asked me to refer to a particular page in the claimant's bundle and was
then astounded that | couldn't as | had never received the claimant's bundle. He then stated that
the claimant was in breach of the court order and was minded to halt the hearing but after 3 or so
minutes stated that since we were all there and that despite the fact that | hadn't received the
bundle he was sure that I'd probably seen most of it at some point and he proceeded anyway
(asking me to spend my lunch hour making myself familiar with the claimant's 100 plus page
bundle). | can state that in writing but since there is no recording and therefore no transcript, |
cannot prove it other than to provide evidence of the email that | sent to the judge ahead of the
hearing.
STUART J, Solicitor
| hear everything that you say and | cannot disagree with you.
Your complaint however will not resolve it.
Handwritten notes cannot be backed with evidence but if you can prove that they were done at the
time, the court is likely to accept it.
Although there may not be a transcript the judges notes would be taken as gospel.Judges make
copious notes.Your email is also good evidence because that’s prior to the hearing.Remember that
things only have to be decided on the balance of probabilities, more likely than not.So all you need

Thank you Stuart. It would seem that if the judge's notes are taken as gospel then anything | note
is irrelevant. Forgive me for saying this but some judges have very large egos and | cannot see
this judge stating that he two very significant mistakes, one | can only prove with a transcript, the
other in permitting the hearing to proceed having been notified ahead of the hearing (and again at
the hearing) that the claimant had not followed the court order and had not shared their evidence,
leaving me to answer questions relating to evidence | was seeing for the first time at the hearing.
Again, thank you for your advice. Incidentally, there are no 5 starts at the top of my page.
STUART J, Solicitor
No need to apologise for making your comments about the judges. | couldn't agree more.| have
known judges accept evidence on the day without allowing the other person to take legal advice
on the effect and have known other judges disallow it because it was a day late. No consistency.
To my mind, a miss is as good as a mile and of its daylight it's not allowed otherwise there is no
point in having the court order in the first place.
Sometimes the star rating doesn't crop up but thank you anyway.
STUART J, Solicitor

also that the findings found against me were photos taken after alledged incidents with no
witness’s to back them up. | was accused of strangling ex wife which judge found in my favour. But
found against me for pushing ex wife into radiator cuz she provided a photo of an old bruise and
no other evidence, verbal abuse based on a text message row. Gas lighting because | referrred to
her depression tablets as head meds in a text but we both called them head meds. And no the
section 7 report reflects those findings and I'm being treated like a murder, they recommed | get to

SASH_LAW, Lawyer
You are out of time to appeal it at this stage - you would have had 21 days from the date of the
hearing to do so.
What you should do now is challenge the cafcass report and focus on how to ask the judge for
the level of contact you would like.
You could apply to appeal out of time, but that is a high hurdle to get over, and if | am honest
with you, the reasons you gave above do not appear to reach the level required to actually
appeal. b

judge or magistrates, and form FP161 if it was conducted by a circuit judge.

SASH_LAW, Family Lawyer
In that case you won't need to obtain permission to appeal as an appeal from magistrates is
automatic.
But you still need grounds on which to appeal.
You can only appeal an order if the magistrates made an error of fact, law or procedure. You
must appeal an interim judgment within 7 days, and a final judgment within 21 days of the
hearing. If you are late, or out of time to appeal, you must apply for permission to appeal, which
you do on the same form as your substantive appeal. 0

26/10/2025, 12:04 I would like to know how to appeal a family court final hearing decision. (No child arrangements) Yes, yes, i was
To appeal you need form N161, and you will be required to order a transcript of the hearing you
are appealing, produce your grounds of appeal (what errors of fact, law or procedure the judge
made), and a skeleton argument detailing the law that you are seeking to rely on to support the
grounds of appeal.
Appealing is difficult and it is very likely you will need a solicitor to go over the transcript for you
to see if there are in fact grounds to appeal the decision. Be aware that if you lose, you may be
asked to pay the other side’s costs.
Form N161 and notes to help you complete it are here:
https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/form-n161-appellants-notice-all-appeals-exceptsmall-claims-track-appeals-and-appeals-to-the-family-division-of-the-high-court
You can find a solicitor here: solicitors.lawsociety.org.uk
You will need form EX107 to obtain the transcript, and the notes to help you complete that form.

SASH_LAW, Lawyer
Did you speak to your barrister about whether you have grounds to appeal?
No, | will ask you some questions and answer online for you - it won't cost extra.
Customer reply
| told the barrister | want to appeal, he only said | have 21 days to appeal. But he told me to find a
solicitor. He didn't tell me much.
| told him we had so many things to say in court, but he protected himself saying he did his duty.
But what | wanted him to say he didn't say.
There are other things that weren't fair: the court bundle didn't have 2 of my position statements. |
challenged the welfare report, the social worker was bias, she knew | was complaining about her
and she took my ex side. She changed her recommendations from one hearing to another. The
magestry considered she was a trust person. My barrister didn't ask her the questions | told him to
ask.
SASH_LAW, Lawyer
You do only have 21 days to appeal, and you have to do quite a lot in order to get to that stage -
and the first point would be for your barrister to say whether you have grounds to do so.
Customer reply
During the court hearing, my barrister had to speak with me 3 times as he wasn't sure about my
ideas.

| am so confused.
SASH_LAW, Lawyer
Bear with me, | will type up the appeal process.
Customer reply
Thank you.
SASH_LAW, Lawyer
You can only appeal an order if the judge made an error of fact, law or procedure. You must
appeal an interim judgment within 7 days, and a final judgment within 21 days of the hearing. If
you are late, or out of time to appeal, you must apply for permission to appeal, which you do on
the same form as your substantive appeal.
To appeal you need form N161, and you will be required to order a transcript of the hearing you
are appealing, produce your grounds of appeal (what errors of fact, law or procedure the judge
made), and a skeleton argument detailing the law that you are seeking to rely on to support the
grounds of appeal.
Appealing is difficult and it is very likely you will need a solicitor to go over the transcript for you
to see if there are in fact grounds to appeal the decision. Be aware that if you lose, you may be
asked to pay the other side’s costs.
Form N161 and notes to help you complete it are here:
https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/form-n161-appellants-notice-all-appeals-exceptsmall-claims-track-appeals-and-appeals-to-the-family-division-of-the-high-court
You can find a solicitor here: solicitors.lawsociety.org.uk
You will need form EX107 to obtain the transcript, and the notes to help you complete that form.

The universiy has just boen (effectvely) refusing to abide by i This has occurred in roughly three ways: (1) not dealing with some of my complaints at al (2) dealing with some other complaints
dishonestly, &.g., prefending i was not a problem in spite o evidence given (3) in yet some other cases, by ealing with the compiaint properly but, afer upholing it they didn' do anything i terms of ropars, as f
othing big had happened bu, nstead, they just gave verbal apologies that amount to nothing in terms of epairs(they are even modking finsuling, considering the Grcumstance). Ifs like (for example) someone has committed arson to a house, or (another example) a car accident, and when the party Who is
responsible,instead of paying damages for the bumt house ! for the damaged car,say -upon being investigated and found guity “oh, sorry". And then they tellyou that they “solvedr the situation because they ‘apologised. In some ofher cases, the universiy also deleted evidence and / of refuses 1o isclose it otc There are ofher Variations 1o how the university deal with compiaint, but mainly the above threo categories
(1)not dealing with complaints at al 2)dealing withthem dishonestly (including but not by far limited 1o deleting evidence or blocking my access it 3)doing things properly up tohe point where the complaint s upheld, but then giving a verbal apology that ‘amounts to nothing. 1 would lke to emphasize again that there are ample, detaled regulations of how to deal with complaints 5o it should be something very siraightfonvard for the court to order the university (via injunction) to ust ollow those reguiations in practice

I'm sorry to read of the above circumstances. | should be very grateful if you would kindly assist
me with the following queries in the first instance.
1. May | confirm if the court provided you with the notes of the judgment when they sent you the
decision?
2. What exactly did the court say in their request for a "court transcription"? Did they specify what
aspects they need transcribed?
3. What stage is your appeal at now? &
4. Have you contacted the other party in the case to see if they obtained a transcript?
5. What is the deadline given by the judge to provide this transcription?

JOSHUA, Lawyer

Many thanks for the above information. If you wish to proceed with your appeal against the order
the court has directed that you must obtain and submit a transcript of the judgment delivered at
that hearing which is a standard requirement. The order states that you must send this transcript to
the court within 14 days of service of the order.
The court has also provided a link to the official government page that explains how to obtain a
court or tribunal transcript which is quite correct.
www.gov.uk/apply-transcript-court-tribunal-hearing
You would need to apply to an authorised transcription service approved by HMCTS to request the
transcript. You will need to know the case number, the name of the judge, the date and time of the
hearing, and the court location. The application form used is EX107
https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/order-a-transcript-of-court-or-tribunal-proceedingsform-ex107
Once you have completed the application, you should submit it to the transcription company listed
in the court’s list of approved providers. There will be a charge, which varies depending on the
length of the hearing and urgency of the request. After the transcript has been produced, it should
be submitted to the court by email as directed in the order, ensuring that your claim number is
the subject line.
If the deadline for submitting the transcript has already passed as may be the case now, you may
need to write to the court without delay to explain the circumstances, such as your efforts to obtain
the transcript and any delays outside your control and ask for permission to file the transcript out of
time, ideally supported by evidence of the steps you've taken (such as contacting transcription
services). Courts do have discretion to accept late documents where there is good reason and no
significant prejudice arises, but you must act promptly and transparently to mitigate the delay.

Is that the complete statement? The beginning appears to be missing and so does the end. It's
also very badly drafted. Has it come from solicitors?
The majority of court documents take the same format.Here is the format of a Witness Statement
https://www.justice.gov.uk/courts/procedure-rules/civil/standard-directions/general/witnessstatements
Yours would be in the same layout and format but it would be Respondent’s Reply to Applicants
Statement.
Please note that the Statement of Truth at the end of a witness statement has changed and here is
the new wording: https://parissmith.co.uk/blog/guidance-signing-statement-of-truth/
Whether it's a Witness Statement or Particulars of Claim or Defence or Reply to Defence or
whatever, the general layout and the format is the same along with the statement of truth and don’t 1 forget to sign and date it.

Double space each line and put an extra space between paragraphs.Number each paragraph
because it makes it easy for the court to refer to.| would normally not put more than 2 sentences
per paragraph.The paragraphs are for ease of reference, not to break the text up into subject
parts.
Refer to Claimant and Defendant throughout (or Petitioner/Respondent or Applicant/Respondent
as appropriate) and avoid he, she, they.Forget English-language construction.
The following is actually an extract from a recent order of the court.It’s in relation to a child matter
but the basic gist is still useful for any matter
https://formfinder.hmctsformfinder justice.gov.uk/c120-eng.pdfis the layout of the witness statement
| would suggest that in respect of every point you admit or deny or neither admit nor deny or have
any knowledge of everything that she is saying.|f you are denying something was missing it you
can then qualify the reply.
So for example you could say “it is admitted that the Parties met each other but the meeting was
on XYZ date instead of ABC date”.
“Itis denied that the Respondent attacked the Applicant but it is admitted that the Respondent did
raise his voice” that kind of thing.
At the beginning you say who you are and you say that you are using the same paragraph
Numbering as in the Applicants Statement.
Customer reply

STUART J, Solicitor
I'm not bothered about the parties names. However there is no statement of truth at the end but
you may have removed that. | don't know whether there was anything in the rest of the first
paragraph which is relevant. Otherwise, my answers above remains the same.

She supplied negotiations we had on a parenting app as evidence, and accused me of timewasting and wants me to pay her court fees as a result. Is there some way to make my case
without getting stuck in the weeds, as | have copious notes myself but | feel she is trying to muddy
the waters and make things more complicated than they need to be. This is the statement | sent in
at the last court ordered hearing. The judge said he would give me a chance to tell my side based
on the statement.
STUART J, Solicitor
Thank you. So you now have to reply to her statement.
Customer reply
| think you are saying | must give an answer to each point made with opposing evidence point by
point. | had hoped the fact | hadn't signed anything was enough especially given her side would
not confirm whether or not the agreement was valid - Thanks | will go back to her statement and
try and 'admit' / 'deny"
STUART J, Solicitor
It doesn't matter whether you sign anything or not. They are making the allegations and you
have to counter them. Agreements don't have to be in writing.

Hi there,

26/10/2025, 12:14 I'have filed in a EX107 in March but have not heard back from the employment tribunal This is for a preliminary hearing.
Generally it's good practice (though not always mandatory) to:
Inform the Respondent that you've applied for a transcript (via EX107).
Serve a copy of your application if the tribunal rules or judge required it.
To get an update on your case you can call or email the relevant Employment Tribunal where your
case was heard providing:
Your case number
Date of hearing
Date you submitted EX107
and Ask for a status update on your EX107 request.
& EX107 forms are processed by approved transcription companies (e.g. DRS, Epiq, Opus 2).
When you submitted EX107, you should have:
Chosen a transcription company
Possibly sent it to them as well as the tribunal
If you remember which company you selected, you can directly follow up with them as well.
If nothing works and you urgently need the transcript (for example, for an appeal or future
hearing), you can apply to the Tribunal for a Case Management Order under Rule 29 to:- Confirm
the status of the transcript
- Request a judge to direct the production of the hearing record.

Discussions between judges about a case are generaly not partof the nomal judical process, especially when it comes to individual heaith maters. The confidentiality of medical information is crucial, and judges are expected to make dedisions based on the evidence prosented in court. I you have reason 1o befiove
that the Masters in your two concurrent cases have discussed your medical feport and drawn inforences ‘about your health, you may have grounds to be concerned about the impartiaity of the proceedings.
A this point, your next steps could involve formally addressing this issue within the court systom. You may Want o raise the ssus with the court and express your concerns about the confidentialty of your medical information being discussed beween Mastars. You can consider making an application for one or both of the Masters o recuse themselves from your cases, ctig the potential breach of confidentiaiy and the
impact on the percepton of impartalty.
Hence, if you believe that the judges' actons have compromised the faimess of the proceedings, bringing this mater o the attention of the Judicial Conduct Investigations Offce (CIO) could also be an option. The JCIOs responsibie for handiing complaints about the personal conduct ofjudical offceholders. 1 can see the platiorm has offered you a call I you do not need one we can continue o discuss here on the chat.If you change your mind and want a cal feei free to request and we can arrange for one for you.

“The situation you're facing i indoed complex and concerning. If hearings proceeded in your absence without proper notice, particularly considering your medical crcumstances, it raises questions about famess. ‘and impartalty, which are vial standards judges should uphold. In such cases, ifs appropriate for you o raise these issues.
Regarding the judges in your case, they usually stay on unless they choose o recuse themselves or are removed by an authorty. Ifyou'e appealing one of the cases, the orginal tral judge may not be involved, as
‘appeas are often heard by differentjudges. You can request a judge's recusal f there's a perceived confict of interest or bias. This s done formally through legal processes, not pivate meetings, which coukd be inappropriate. I you belleve bias or mproper ‘conduct has significantly impacted your cases, asking for them 1o be fotied by a diferent judge is a valid opton. Suppose you tink the judges’ conduct has affected the farness of your tal. In that case, this concem can boa basis for an appeal focusing on legal grounds ke judiial bias or procedural issues. You can approach the Judicial Conduct Investigations Ofice (JCIO) forformal complaints about judicial
‘conduct. This requires providing detaied information and evidence of any misconduct.

2/11
27/10/2025, 11:12 I have two concurrent cases going on in the High Court. | had to get them in at the same time because of limitation
the time this time o even apply, - with two cases going on.So anyway, ths lawyer is an intenational awyer and he's often abroad Soi's been very diffcutt pinning him down and the agreement we have is | do the aratting and he does the correcting. Which isn't great, (as Im slow) - but am trying to make him do as it s possible. Soit's nota traditional barfistericlient elationship. n the past, when Ive had pro bono lawyers, they ask me questions, ask for supporiing evidence and then they draft beautiuly - which is very helpful
bocause | overthink, and overwirite everything and that's kind of where my mental health ssues fie. | wite
for a living and writng and law are very diferent discipines and | fa allhe time by overthinking legal things ‘and over compicating them. So anyway, these adjoured hearings in my absence, fesulted in los of misinformation, and assumplions that were wrong, and the Masters afttude changed siighty afterwards, and he seemed to become very expedient. Ho wanted fo get my case over and done wih as quickly as
possible. Along with the defendant, they woukin' allow the date that my counsel was avalable just two. wesks later — and they kept saying they wanted 10 get it all sorted out beforo the summer break. S0
bocause they would not wait wo weeks, | ended up on my own again as a iigant n person and that was. Very difficult for me been having to deal with stuff on my own, when | actually HAD representation, but on dates they were not amenable o.The ofher case, which i the one I've contacted you abou - is about dishonesty and concealment as | have evidenced. The other side denied that | sent them evidence of a ‘substantial lump sum raised to dlear an alleged "shortfal’. They also denied evidence of key comespondence | had sent and that money went inio the instuucted sofiitors cient account and was meant 1o pay them. Anyway | don't wanna go into those detalls right now. But the second case is what | contacted
You about. the reason | need help s | discovered in late summer this thing about my medical evidence
being discussed between the two Masters and Im not happy about tand my dodtor is also really unhappy ‘about tAnyway, the case is a compicated and difficult one because s involves dishonesty, concealment ‘and potential perury - not easy for a someone i person o figate on her own at the best of times. But 1o have incontrovertible evidence to show there has boen dishonesty. A problem is e beon very i this year. | was very ilin May and | had a lung nfection, so the master (who | Tiked biw) gave me quite along time to
prepare my stuft. know It would be sometime after the summer break in autumn because we had discussed it at the time.Then In the summor just before the break in August | had my hearing of the first
‘case againstthe defendants strkeout and although | had very strong grounds and mert, the inevitable
happened and my case was siruck out. So I've been preparing the grounds of appeal for that, and going found and round i circles a kot ever since.And the thing that has made i worse was the discovery of the medical report that my doclor wrote and carefully prepared and which the first master referred o the other
master which suggested that they talked about , | found that reall triggering. Triggering because of the amount of losses 've sustained, because of being il and absent at several hearings and unable to defend myself Anyway, the case thatis relevant today and that | need help wit is the second case, so what happencd was that the judge was pretty good and gave me ute along time in
June when 1 was clearly il with a lung infecton and | have hospita evidence to show. | also had medical ‘evidence to back it up that | had this both lung nfection and other mental health issues ke anxiety and depression and | was on anlidepressanis. So even he was a tough judge he allowed me until autum to
prepare what was pretty crucial evidence. Histoic and otherwise However because of a number ofissues that happened: | completely missed the date of that hearing. Firsty (1) my phone was stolen in July which
had my email and passwords and | didn't get any nofifications about court dates. Secondly (2) | Had ahvays received hardcopies from the defendant as well as emals. But they stopped; so | just assumed no date boen found. (3) Sadly | was very very caught up inthis unhappiness about the discovery of this medical of
my medicalinformation being discussed and iferences being drawn, and that was all 2 ind of perfect Stom.Then again, the defendant he second matter contacted my lawyer, my counsel just hree days before. the hearing to do a drop hand agreement -which | didn't want to do. And it was only then that my lawyer mentioned to me that the hearing was on the 14th of October - which compietely shocked me as | assumed thought they were st looking forfing a date, and were yet o agree. | mmediataly appiied for reff rom Sanction for a new date, just for a short tme. | explained that there were a number ofissues indluding my
phone, being stolen, and not being able o repiace theontent of t; my healthissues, and the factthat no one had told me or contacted me from out of the court o the other side and there had been no ‘communication of any kind.The intervention of the defendant on my pro bono lawyer caused him to wak ‘away from representing me, although f I'm honest, | think itis as much to do with me, not draftng things in ‘enough time which as | saidis one of my undertying issues. But i was definel affected by the defendant contacing him three days of al the hearingSo | am now trying to put together grounds of appeal for the
Second time. And I'm back to where | started. What do | o wih this iformation about my medical report which has upsot me a Iot? it has upset me to the point almost of paralysisinthe summer, and the reason being because I'velost
pretty much everything through being i, and not being presen at hearings, and a great deal of advantage: was taken of me. So for peopl 1o be discussing al the nuances and evidence of my mental and physical health issues s distutbing 1o me. And that's where you come in Martin at the moment. 'm sty s 5o longwinded and dragged out but just thought you should know as much as s necessary. There s 5o much more which v akready deleted. | would be interesiad to know what you think, and what you suggest, Zachaina. Another thingis, 've tred desperately to engaging preaction protocal | don'tneed or have any massive: ‘expectations abouttial. Obviously | won with a briliant legal team it woul be probably worth a substantial
‘amount of money. But| am very grounded in my expectations and | have just been rejected in my effots to 6050 these issues without the need for trial They have al boen refected. But aren' judges these days, meantto be mindful of ADR and meant to mention t? To propose it? And to ask what had happened with t?
“They re not meant 1o just ignore it are they? Oh the times they are a changing? Anyway, 'l check back on this ifyou ke inthe morning because you must be pretty tied speak then.

When deaiing with concerns about judges discussing your medical information and possible bias, s ssentialto address this issue formally, ether in court or by fiing a complaint with the Judicial Conduct Investigations Office inthe UK. The challenges youve faced with missed court dates due 1o health issues ‘and communication problems, ke the theft of your phone, shoukd be clearly communicated o the court. s you prepare for appeais, focus on areas where you belleve there were legal errors, such as potential

Martin. Sorry 11ty again to be clearer. And {0 control my phone which seems to have a mind of s ownlAs
You stated: “The challenges you've faced with missed cout dates due o health issues and communication problems, ike the theft of your phone, shoukd be clearly communicated o the court" agree. | have done possibly too long grounds of appeal | think they re ok, but somewhat “overwritien” as usual and theyre. unperfected because they can't be properly finished unfi | have the transcript - which has st ot artivedButl neod to get a shit o and get them in asap. So s it okay 10 do shorter grounds with
‘subheadings for the time being like "Foroed oral evidence” as a heading - and something ke Instead of being granted a short extension to prepare and present evidence in witten form and despite her health issues, the opponent was forced o give oral evidence. This was both unfair and unsafistactory because she ‘could not recall everything relovant there and then, she had been afforded time originaly, recent events learly set out: had made it impossible for her o be able to present her evidence on the date ofthe hearing Efc etc."Should | send you a copy of the shortened groundsjust for you to scan them?

general rule is that an appeal shall not operate as a stay of any order or decision ofthe lower cout, Whether the cour should exercise its iscretion o grant a sty wil depend upon allthe circumstances of the case, but the essential queston is "whether there is sk of injusice to on or both partis it ranis or refuses a siay". * Particular questions are as fllows: If a tay s refused what are the isks of an appeal being stlea?

1 note that the High Coutt Appeal Judge has denied your appiicaton for a tay of execution and seta Geadine of January 2, 2024, for you o fle an appeal bundie, which indludes specified documents and a transaipt of the lower court's judgment. The judge notes that if you are unabie to comply by that date, you must fomally apply for further extension before January 2, 2024. There s also mention of the possibilty of Seting aside or varying the ordor within seven days of service. Your challenge may be complicated by
missing the seven-day period, but s crucial to act prompt. In terms of your ongoing health issues, indluding your eye condition, providing relevant medical evidence could strengthen your case, especialy it impacts your abilty to handle court communications and dates.

The judge was. wrong not o allow a short adjourment due to extenuating personal circumstances, and other key factors. “The Judge erred by dismissing a number of sigrnficant factors ncluding the theft of criical nformation from the appellants phone and a lack of received communication about the hearing date, causing gentine
oversight, The judge shoud in all the circumstances, have allowed further opportunity considering the ‘appelants ircumstances, including health issues and theft of her phone, hindering her preparation.Ground 2.1t was unveasonable, technically wrong, and wrong in law fo the Learned Judge to dismiss the ‘appellants entire allegation, and case against the fourth defendant on the basis of failed personal SonviceThe judge's decision o dismiss this part of the appeliants ciaim was was wrong, and misguided
particularly given the context o the respondents own service misdemeanours. The appelant had explained that serial, egregious mis service over a number of years from the respondent had materialy prohibited the
‘appellants access to justice leading nevitably to substantiallosses. In the context of that aone, she should
ot have had her dlaim against the respondent and struck out. Particuarly as the allegations of ishonesty ‘and concealment against the fourth defendant were so serious. The appeliant dd everything with her power to make good service, including paying for a courer n Bristol, and making sure that he defvered it porsonally, and marking the envelope, ‘private and confidenta’ There was nothing more the appellant could have done in the cicumstances. To dismiss this partof a claim was both misguided and wrong in law.Ground 3. Failure of communication
“The Judge overiooked the fact tha the appellant had heard nothing ffom the cout or espondent for a
prolonged period prir o the hearing. she feceived neiher emal communication nor hard copy corespondence m. This was not considered, resulfing in a lack of clariy for the appeliant regarding her representation for the hearing date Ground 4. Loss of representation “The judge ered by not granting an extansion ofime or adjoumment upon knawing the appelant fost pro. bono representation, shorty after the respondent making contact with him, leading to nequalty of amns and Genying her a fair opportunity.Ground 5.

Falure to acknowledge the appolants vuinerabilty under CPR 1A and her documented medical diffcultes

The appeliant had been used to receiving at the very least hardcopies by post fom both court ‘and respondent. She appreciates that the respondent may not have been ‘required' to includs herin comespondance, once in contact with her counsel, but tis easonabie to expect that important information
ke dates, should have been shared with al parties involied, and by hard copy. It would also have been wise and prudent for the fespondent to nform her that they would no longer be contacting her directy whilst ‘communicating with her counsel. But this did not happen.Ongoing ey and vision issues: The appelant has explained mulipl times of an autoimmune conditon that causes ongoing eyesight and vision problems. This condition often leads to her ‘missing detalls and affects her abiity 1o ead and see
properly when it has flared up o an excessive or uncomfortable degreeLate nofificaton from counsel: “The appelant was not aware of any fixed dates for the hearing unti a couple of days before. She had received no natification including from her barrster unt the lastfow days. They had communicated briefl,
but at ross purposes. Her counsel thought she was aware and did not mention the date untia couple of
days before. The appellant i turn, assumed it had not yet been fixed because it had not been referred to by counsal; whowas largely discussing recent contract made by the respondent. She was deeply shocked to then ind out ha the hearing was just days away. She may have boen copied i or tod earlier on, butfor whatever reason it had not ‘registered on her. She just believed that there was a date that nesded o be frmed up past Septomber 2023, This miscommunication: - one of the documented issues the appellant has
referred 1o when discussing CPR 1A - led the appeliant to believe thatthe date had notyet boen
fxedInvolvement n another urgent matter: “The appelant was simutaneously deeply immersed in another matter that required her full attention, and. that had disclosed dificut information that had affected her abily o ligate. Without a fixed date for the. hearing, she priorfised condluding the other mater first,
(Contnued). Seriousness Of Case. Moreover on the seriousness and gravity of the allegations of ishonesty and concealment alone, and within the case fsef, - the learned Judge should have allowed a short extension of time. There was no
timetable, no tralor speific dates that the appellants oversight affected. It did not cause prejudice o the respondent. And the appellant should not have be deprived of an opportuniy 1o progress such an mportant ‘caseThess circumstances, when considered together, were an unusual and regretiable, perfoct storn’ ~
that significanty impacted the appelants abilty to prepare adequately for the hearing. Her reasons were
genuine, regretiable,and based on a series of events that culminated in the missed hearing date. The. judge's failure o recognise and evaluate these factors constituted an erforof law and fed o the procedural imegularity and ulimately an unfair ral in the appelants case.
GROUND 2
Inadequate nolice regarding the case bundie hindered the appellants abity to defend herself properly. “The appelant, especialyin view ofjust losing her counsel, was dlearl cisacvantaged by the late delvery of the bundle ust days before the hearing, and aiso apparently inlate Seplember. Even if the hearing date had ot been missed, the appellant would have been entiled to an adjoumment as the bundle, presented the.
ay beforeland at some pointin September, meant there was was simply 0o e time afforded her to process the inormation and caselaw. This was something the appellant had made diear previously: needed time to process the information, if i person - which she found herselfin a that poin. On that basis, alone,
given al the circumstances, the judge shouldve allowed a short extension of time. This was a procedural Wmeguarty________________GROUND3LOSSOF REPRESENTATION “The judge erred, in faiing to considor that the appellantlost her crucial pro bono representaton just before.

unprepared toligate against a stike out and summary judgment application. This was manifestly unfai;
Yot was disregarded by the learned judge.This sinificant omission adversely affected the faimess and final judgment of the case. While the reasons for thisloss may be complex and not solel the respondents faut it nevertheless shows beyond a doubt that the respondents actions and inluence impacted onthe outcome, ‘and the impact remains significant. On this basis alone, the judge should have allowed a short adjournment “The judge ered by not granting an extansion of ime or adjoumment upon knawing the appelant was now without represantation, leading to inequality of arms and denying the appellant a fair opportunity. This was wrong in law and a procedural iregulariy; as well as making a fairtrial impossibie.

Firsl, you can request speciic documentsn your court bundle, such as previous assessments, police reporls, and ‘communication with other professionals. This wil provide necessary information for addressing accusations in your judicial review. Second, you can ask for an adjourment of the assessment due 1o health reasons ‘and focus on preparing forthe judicial review. Poliely deine the assessment, explain your situation, and

“Their responses serve as a valuable foundation for bulding your case fo the judicial feview. Here's a ‘summary of their answers and how you can leverage them:Key Points to Strengthen Your Case: 1. Cannabis Allegation: Their nabilty o confirm the source or any invesiigation weakens their rationale for
the Child Protection Plan (CPP) 2. Police Entry: They shift responsibilty to the police. Consider requesting disciosure of relevant police records from the June 16ih incident. Your "Leter Before Claim” reflects your atiempt o resolve the stuation through legal channels.
3. Justiication for Inervention: They emphasize theirduty to safequard chikren. You can challenge ths by arguing that their actions, such as forced entry and repeated vsits, caused undue stress that could hamn
Your chidren's wel-being. 4. Biological Father Misiformation: Acknowledgement of the erfor and commitment o update the record
highlights potentialinaccuracies in ther report. 5. Objectivy: Their response lacks specific examples, raising doubls about the impartiaty o their ‘assessments. Additonal Points for the Court Bundie: - Include copies of your correspondence requesting information and their esponses. - Ifyou have medical records documenting your health issues, consider ncluding them with necessary
privacy redactions. - Include any evidence that contradics thefrclaims, such as feceipts for home improvements.Focus on the.
Judicial Review:
Whie these responses offe valuable insights, prioritize completing your court bundie for the judiial reviow. ‘Concentrate on disproving the accusations and demonsirating that the CPP was implemented without
proper justiication. Is there anyihing specific you need assistance with as you prepare for the judicil review?

Hello Lea.
My name is’ need to appeal against a decision of East London Family court's order regarding
the custody of my children. | need to know the process of appeal. | used to be on Legal Aid, |
discharged my lawyer, they did not represent me well. This legal battle lasts already for 2.5 years.
The Court took CAFCASS recommendation. CAFCASS officer took my ex-husband viewpoint and
disregarded my children's wishes. My children went to GP to seek reconciliation with me, the GP
confirmed that.

26/10/2025, 11:56 I need to appeal a court decision re children custody. | also suffered domestic abuse
What was the order made?
Customer reply
Hi Lea,
The order is not made yet. On the hearing the judge said she will issue a variation order, meaning
she will take the last order and vary it a little. The last order was that | can see children in contact
centre with supervision. Now the judge allowed the contact to move into "community" supervised
by a person agreed by both parents. | wanted 100% custody based on my children visited the GP
asking to help with reconciliation. This is major development, until that the father told to the court
that children dont want to see me. So, the father (resident parent and my ex-husband) lied to the
court
SASH_LAW, Lawyer
An order is made at the hearing - so the judge has already decided to vary the order and give the
father contact in the community, is that correct?
Is that what you are wanting to appeal?
Customer reply
Hi Lea,
The order was made against me. My ex was a lawyer in the past and he knew how to act. So, he
put a NMO against me while | was in hospital. So, | try to dispute the order for the last 2.5 years

And that is what you wish to appeal?
Customer reply
correct
SASH_LAW, Lawyer
You can only appeal an order if the judge made an error of fact, law or procedure. You don't
appear to be saying the judge made an error of one of these things, but if you think he/she did,
then what you need to do to appeal is set out below.
To appeal you need form N161, and you will be required to order a transcript of the hearing you
are appealing, produce your grounds of appeal (what errors of fact, law or procedure the judge
made), and a skeleton argument detailing the law that you are seeking to rely on to support the
grounds of appeal.
Appealing is difficult and it is very likely you will need a solicitor to go over the transcript for you
to see if there are in fact grounds to appeal the decision. Be aware that if you lose, you may be
asked to pay the other side’s costs.
You can find a solicitor here: solicitors.lawsociety.org.uk

Lea,
While being married, | suffered a domestic abuse which | was not aware of before. My ex-husband
was abusing me heating me in the head. | did not recall most of it until | started to write witness
statement and had gaps in my memory. | went to GP with a stiff neck and the GP said that | have a
"dowager hump", which is an evidence of domestic abuse. How can | use it to fight for my
children?
On the last hearing | provided the GP statement to the court. But the judge did not pursue it.
Can you suggest how can | use this to fight for my children
SASH_LAW, Lawyer

The inaccuracies in the transcript can be added as a ground of appeal. You could argue for
example that the judge's findings as to fact would be inaccurate in light of the inaccuracies in the

If your grounds have already been filed you would need to file supplemental grounds of appeal.

Good evening and thank you for your question. I'm a partner in a law firm specialising in family law
and dispute resolution so I'd be happy to offer some guidance on this matter.
I'll need a little more information to fully answer your question.
First and foremost, do you have a copy of the order you can upload? If necessary, please redact
any personal info.
Secondly, what was drafted incorrectly? Have you signed the order?
Why have the court directed a banning order against you?
Customer reply

The Christmas dates were supposed to be with dad in Xmas Eve until 11am on Xmas day and
then with me until 18.00 on Boxing Day, not Xmas day. This was from our last court order and
hadn’t been changed in this order. The only thing changed was news years.The banning order was
because | have to keep applying to court as my ex won’t communicate. Because of this there has
been 5 hearings in 4 years and ex is falsely claiming domestic abuse so | got a banning order for 2
years

Hello again. Were these dates actually discussed in court? Were you not sent a copy of the draft
order before it was filed with the court?
Customer reply
Neither of us were represented so the legal advisor in the hearing wrote the order and posted it to
us. Xmas dates were never an issue only new years. The times are right, just should be until
Boxing Day at 18.00 not Xmas day.
This is the only copy we are sent
Was heard by the magistrates
JEREMYT1020, Solicitor
In the first instance, you need to write to the other side's solicitor and reiterate your dates. If they
are not willing to agree to the amended times/days, you may have to appeal. As it was a
magistrates' court that heard the matter, you cannot obtain a transcript as the hearings in
magistrates' courts are never recorded.
If you appeal the order, please bear in mind there is a strict time limit of 21 days to lodge your
appeal. If the other side are unco-operative over changing the date voluntarily, you will probably
have to threaten them with the appeal.
Customer reply
Thank you for your reply.l was under the impression that the family court hearings were recorded
no matter what court they were heard in so | now believe I'm stuck.
My ex is very controlling but has flipped it on me to make out | am. He is still refusing to
communicate even though the judge ordered him to. | have asked him to agree the dates are
wrong but | am getting ignored as usual. He doesn’t have a solicitor.
It has always been that he has all of xmas eve and me xmas day and boxing day as he doesn’t
celebrate xmas day. Obviously he now won't agree to change this as he knows it is upsetting for
me.The order was made on 21st May and | received the order 2 weeks ago. | have been writing to
the court regarding this and what | have to do to get it amended but also no reply.
| don't think | can appeal now | am banned.
Customer reply
What form will | need to lodge an appeal? | am only appealing as the order is different to what was
agreed in court. This is a mistake in the wording. It's not that | didn’t agree to what the judge
agreed in court. 1

i \vill still have to consider your appeal even if there is a section 91 in place. This is
because, whilst a section 91 is meant to prevent 'frivolous' applications, to blanket ban a genuine
application is likely to infringe your human rights.I'll just send you the link to the appeal form used

26/10/2025, 12:01 I'was in family court for a directions hearing yesterday after a S7 report recommended a Fact Finding and no interim
Judge said that because it will be a 4 day FFH that it will likely be next summer so set up contact in
the interim.. against CAFCASS recommendation. | feel CAFCASS took all this into consideration
and against mine and Dad's suggestions of supervised, recommended no interim. Having read the
S7 and how significant the abuse would have been even at their young age, | agree with
CAFCASS that not even Supervised is safe.
SASH_LAW, Family Lawyer
Did the judge order the supervised contact without your agreement?
SASH_LAW, Family Lawyer
That's quite an unusual stance to take.
Did the judge fully explain their reasons for going against cafcass' recommendations?
Customer reply
They commented that in the S7 interview | agreed to supervised.. but a lot more has happened
since and his lies are very concerning
Just said it was because of the time frame. But | believe that CAFCASS knew this as even to me
said it would be a considerable length of time.
SASH_LAW, Family Lawyer
Are you concerned that the father will be directly abusive to the child?
Customer reply
| believe that the Supervised helps negate that part of the abuse, but not other aspects. And not
against the rest of the family. He is destroying me emotionally and I'm barely hanging on, this will
be too much. Their siblings cried, Dad has a son from another relationship who was planning on
refusing contact if he didn't get contact with my child as they don't want anything to do with Dad,
but had said they will keep going to protect toddler ifiwhen unsupervised is granted.

Is your question today then, whether or not you may have grounds for appeal?
Customer reply
how to go about it. Indirect is for 6 weeks (3x cards) then direct contact, so not sure how much
time | have.
SASH_LAW, Family Lawyer
What level of judge made the order - a district judge or a circuit judge?
Customer reply
| don't know. It was in County court
SASH_LAW, Family Lawyer
You can only appeal an order if the judge made an error of fact, law or procedure. You must
appeal an interim judgment within 7 days. If you are late, or out of time to appeal, you must
apply for permission to appeal, which you do on the same form as your substantive appeal.
An appeal from magistrates or district judge goes to the circuit judge at the same court.
To appeal you need form N161, and you will be required to order a transcript of the hearing you
are appealing, produce your grounds of appeal (what errors of fact, law or procedure the judge
made), and a skeleton argument detailing the law that you are seeking to rely on to support the
grounds of appeal.
Appealing is difficult and it is very likely you will need a solicitor to go over the transcript for you
to see if there are in fact grounds to appeal the decision. Be aware that if you lose, you may be
asked to pay the other side’s costs.
Form N161 and notes to help you complete it are here:

Customer reply
| have Legal aid, but assume they wont support this appeal
What costs will the other side have? Do you mean if this does go back to court? They are self
representing.
SASH_LAW, Family Lawyer
Yes, legal fees.
If self representing, then they may not have legal fees - but for an appeal, lots of people instruct
a lawyer.
Legal Aid will only support an appeal if they are sure you have a good chance of success.
Customer reply
Hmm he might just to occur costs...
My solicitor a very lack lustre, so don't think they would support anything
SASH_LAW, Family Lawyer
It's more about whether there are actual grounds to appeal or not. If the judge made an interim
order regarding contact whilst ignoring cafcass recommendations, they would have to fully
explain that - if they did not, then that may be grounds for appeal as it would be an error.
But | am going by what you have said - your solicitor, or whoever represented you in court, will
be the one who can tell you if there was in fact an error made that is worthwhile appealing on.

SASH_LAW, Family Lawyer
They will talk to you about whether you have grounds for appeal - LAA won't be involved until
they say yes or no...if your solicitors say there are no grounds, or no prospect of success, you'll
need to fund an appeal yourself if you wish to go down that route.

Kind Regards
Good afternoon,
1. Can you provide more information about the specific procedures that should have been followed
in the court's recording system?
2. Have you received any formal explanation or apology from the court regarding their failure to
use the manual backup system?
3. How does not having a transcript of the hearing put you at a severe disadvantage in your
appeal?
STUART J, Solicitor
Hello again.
| see that you have not had a chance to get back to me with the information | requested. It would
really help me if | had the full background please.
Based on the limited information provided, let me answer you as far as | can at this stage in time.
If this isn’t what you are looking for or doesn’t answer your question, please respond and we can
continue this thread until all your queries are answered.
Meanwhile.....
You can complain about the lack of transcript and follow-up and procedures but it's not going to
actually do you any good.
All'you can do therefor is rely on your handwritten notes and submit those as evidence of what
was said and agreed.lt really is as simple as that.
Customer reply
Good afternoon Stuart. I'm at work so I've not been able to respond. 1. It is my understanding that
HM Courts & Tribunals Service's (HMCTS's) guidance to staff in March 2011 instructed all courts
to carry out frequent checks on recording equipment. This clearly was not undertaken by
Middlesborough. 2. | have received correspondence (at the 4th time of asking) which does include
an apology from the court but no explanation other than they had not realised that the recording
equipment wasn't working and that because no one realised, they hadn't reverted to a manual
recording as is usually the case. 3 It niite ma at a savar disaduantana as | rannnt hack yp

Customer reply
It is my intention to complain formally about the the inability to obtain a recording and therefore a
transcript. It defies logic and fairness that complaining won't do any good but thanks for letting me
know that you believe it wouldn't. Unfortunately handwritten notes can not be backed with
evidence - for example the judge at the hearing was contacted 3 days prior to the hearing by me to
explain that | hadn't received the claimant's bundle. The judge stated at the hearing that he had
received my email but had decided to proceed only to later clearly demonstrate that he had clearly
not read the email as he asked me to refer to a particular page in the claimant's bundle and was
then astounded that | couldn't as | had never received the claimant's bundle. He then stated that
the claimant was in breach of the court order and was minded to halt the hearing but after 3 or so
minutes stated that since we were all there and that despite the fact that | hadn't received the
bundle he was sure that I'd probably seen most of it at some point and he proceeded anyway
(asking me to spend my lunch hour making myself familiar with the claimant's 100 plus page
bundle). | can state that in writing but since there is no recording and therefore no transcript, |
cannot prove it other than to provide evidence of the email that | sent to the judge ahead of the
hearing.
STUART J, Solicitor
| hear everything that you say and | cannot disagree with you.
Your complaint however will not resolve it.
Handwritten notes cannot be backed with evidence but if you can prove that they were done at the
time, the court is likely to accept it.
Although there may not be a transcript the judges notes would be taken as gospel.Judges make
copious notes.Your email is also good evidence because that’s prior to the hearing.Remember that
things only have to be decided on the balance of probabilities, more likely than not.So all you need
to do is tip the balance in your favour you have enough evidence to do that.
Does that all make sense now whether or not it's the answer you wanted and whether or not is the
answer which you expected.?
Have | answered all your questions for you?
If you have any further queries or need any clarification, | am happy to answer any specific points
arising from this.
Please don't hesitate to ask.

Customer reply
Thank you Stuart. It would seem that if the judge's notes are taken as gospel then anything | note
is irrelevant. Forgive me for saying this but some judges have very large egos and | cannot see
this judge stating that he two very significant mistakes, one | can only prove with a transcript, the
other in permitting the hearing to proceed having been notified ahead of the hearing (and again at
the hearing) that the claimant had not followed the court order and had not shared their evidence,
leaving me to answer questions relating to evidence | was seeing for the first time at the hearing.
Again, thank you for your advice. Incidentally, there are no 5 starts at the top of my page.
STUART J, Solicitor
No need to apologise for making your comments about the judges. | couldn't agree more.| have
known judges accept evidence on the day without allowing the other person to take legal advice
on the effect and have known other judges disallow it because it was a day late. No consistency.
To my mind, a miss is as good as a mile and of its daylight it's not allowed otherwise there is no
point in having the court order in the first place.
Sometimes the star rating doesn't crop up but thank you anyway.

witness’s to back them up. | was accused of strangling ex wife which judge found in my favour. But
found against me for pushing ex wife into radiator cuz she provided a photo of an old bruise and
no other evidence, verbal abuse based on a text message row. Gas lighting because | referrred to
her depression tablets as head meds in a text but we both called them head meds. And no the

You are out of time to appeal it at this stage - you would have had 21 days from the date of the
hearing to do so.
What you should do now is challenge the cafcass report and focus on how to ask the judge for
the level of contact you would like.
You could apply to appeal out of time, but that is a high hurdle to get over, and if | am honest
with you, the reasons you gave above do not appear to reach the level required to actually
appeal. b

SASH_LAW, Family Lawyer
When the order was made, what specific reasons did the magistrates give for not making a child
arrangements order?
Customer reply
She said because | Had a poor attitude at the contact centre, | knowingly Gave my son chocolate

in court. Breaking terms of service. But then again, the contact centre didn’t stay in partial

was it definitely magistrates rather than a judge?
Customer reply
The final court order was made yesterday afternoon at 3:30 pm And it was definitely three
magistrates
| don't exactly Feel it Justifies my son losing his right to have a relationship with his father
SASH_LAW, Family Lawyer
In that case you won't need to obtain permission to appeal as an appeal from magistrates is
automatic.
But you still need grounds on which to appeal.
You can only appeal an order if the magistrates made an error of fact, law or procedure. You
must appeal an interim judgment within 7 days, and a final judgment within 21 days of the
hearing. If you are late, or out of time to appeal, you must apply for permission to appeal, which
you do on the same form as your substantive appeal. 0

To appeal you need form N161, and you will be required to order a transcript of the hearing you
are appealing, produce your grounds of appeal (what errors of fact, law or procedure the judge
made), and a skeleton argument detailing the law that you are seeking to rely on to support the
grounds of appeal.
Appealing is difficult and it is very likely you will need a solicitor to go over the transcript for you
to see if there are in fact grounds to appeal the decision. Be aware that if you lose, you may be
asked to pay the other side’s costs.
Form N161 and notes to help you complete it are here:
https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/form-n161-appellants-notice-all-appeals-exceptsmall-claims-track-appeals-and-appeals-to-the-family-division-of-the-high-court
You can find a solicitor here: solicitors.lawsociety.org.uk
You will need form EX107 to obtain the transcript, and the notes to help you complete that form.

Did you speak to your barrister about whether you have grounds to appeal?
No, | will ask you some questions and answer online for you - it won't cost extra.
Customer reply
| told the barrister | want to appeal, he only said | have 21 days to appeal. But he told me to find a
solicitor. He didn't tell me much.
| told him we had so many things to say in court, but he protected himself saying he did his duty.
But what | wanted him to say he didn't say.
There are other things that weren't fair: the court bundle didn't have 2 of my position statements. |
challenged the welfare report, the social worker was bias, she knew | was complaining about her
and she took my ex side. She changed her recommendations from one hearing to another. The
magestry considered she was a trust person. My barrister didn't ask her the questions | told him to
ask.
SASH_LAW, Lawyer
You do only have 21 days to appeal, and you have to do quite a lot in order to get to that stage -
and the first point would be for your barrister to say whether you have grounds to do so.
Customer reply
During the court hearing, my barrister had to speak with me 3 times as he wasn't sure about my
ideas.

[e] I'have done that. Its about a university
Its been through the adjudicator. The university fid, the OIA (ihe Offce of the Independent Adjudicator) led. They acted dishonestly. 1 have written evidence for . Infact, the way in which both the University and the OIA acted is part and parcel of the allsged harassrment. 1 have done quite a bt of work in the background, | ©ad documents . 1 6id sond them a leter before action. The university tokd me 10 go 1o the OIA. the OIA said they do not investigate mattars of whather laws have been breached. So, the university made me waste my time for
nothing, only to make me waste more time. Correction: "So, the universty made me go o the OIA for nothing, only to make me waste time.” 1250 wrote more than one complaint against harassment o the unversity. They have been leaving it unsolved for years, while atthe same ime they maintain they followed their procedures elc o putitin
‘simplo words, pretty brazen fies and very dishonest)

1fyou disagreed with a uriversiy decision or wanted to appeal then drecting you o the OIA would have been comect despite the out come. 1fyou feel they have harmed you them you coukd send a letter before claim seting out a claim for ‘compensation i they dont settle then you coud take them to court

the university to deal with my complaints properly (honestly, without ignoring evidence etc) shouid say there are ample and detailed documentation (regulations the university has to abide by) regarding how to deal with complaints. The universiy has just boen (effectvely) refusing to abide by i This has occurred in roughly three ways: (1) not dealing with some of my complaints at al (2) dealing with some other complaints
dishonestly, &.g., prefending i was not a problem in spite o evidence given (3) in yet some other cases, by ealing with the compiaint properly but, afer upholing it they didn' do anything i terms of ropars, as f
othing big had happened bu, nstead, they just gave verbal apologies that amount to nothing in terms of epairs(they are even modking finsuling, considering the Grcumstance). Ifs like (for example) someone has committed arson to a house, or (another example) a car accident, and when the party Who is
responsible,instead of paying damages for the bumt house ! for the damaged car,say -upon being investigated and found guity “oh, sorry". And then they tellyou that they “solvedr the situation because they ‘apologised. In some ofher cases, the universiy also deleted evidence and / of refuses 1o isclose it otc There are ofher Variations 1o how the university deal with compiaint, but mainly the above threo categories
(1)not dealing with complaints at al 2)dealing withthem dishonestly (including but not by far limited 1o deleting evidence or blocking my access it 3)doing things properly up tohe point where the complaint s upheld, but then giving a verbal apology that ‘amounts to nothing. 1 would lke to emphasize again that there are ample, detaled regulations of how to deal with complaints 5o it should be something very siraightfonvard for the court to order the university (via injunction) to ust ollow those reguiations in practice

I'm sorry to read of the above circumstances. | should be very grateful if you would kindly assist
me with the following queries in the first instance.
1. May | confirm if the court provided you with the notes of the judgment when they sent you the
decision?
2. What exactly did the court say in their request for a "court transcription"? Did they specify what
aspects they need transcribed?
3. What stage is your appeal at now? &
4. Have you contacted the other party in the case to see if they obtained a transcript?
5. What is the deadline given by the judge to provide this transcription?

JOSHUA, Lawyer

Many thanks for the above information. If you wish to proceed with your appeal against the order
the court has directed that you must obtain and submit a transcript of the judgment delivered at
that hearing which is a standard requirement. The order states that you must send this transcript to
the court within 14 days of service of the order.
The court has also provided a link to the official government page that explains how to obtain a
court or tribunal transcript which is quite correct.
www.gov.uk/apply-transcript-court-tribunal-hearing
You would need to apply to an authorised transcription service approved by HMCTS to request the
transcript. You will need to know the case number, the name of the judge, the date and time of the
hearing, and the court location. The application form used is EX107
https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/order-a-transcript-of-court-or-tribunal-proceedingsform-ex107
Once you have completed the application, you should submit it to the transcription company listed
in the court’s list of approved providers. There will be a charge, which varies depending on the
length of the hearing and urgency of the request. After the transcript has been produced, it should
be submitted to the court by email as directed in the order, ensuring that your claim number is
the subject line.
If the deadline for submitting the transcript has already passed as may be the case now, you may
need to write to the court without delay to explain the circumstances, such as your efforts to obtain
the transcript and any delays outside your control and ask for permission to file the transcript out of
time, ideally supported by evidence of the steps you've taken (such as contacting transcription
services). Courts do have discretion to accept late documents where there is good reason and no
significant prejudice arises, but you must act promptly and transparently to mitigate the delay.

My name is Stuart,
Thank you for the question.
It is my pleasure to assist you with this today.
| have been in the UK legal profession, in high street practice, for almost 30 years, so | have a
wide range of experience and a great many different aspects of UK law and in particular, England
& Wales and some Northern Ireland.
Although | am shown as being online, | may be dealing with other people, on the telephone,
or typing.
You will receive an email when I reply.
Just Answer is not a chat service, it's an email reply board.
Sometimes it will be minutes, sometimes it may be longer, even hours or overnight.
| apologise for any delay.
I will now ask you some questions that pertain to your question — please see below.
Have you discussed this statement or the content of the negotiations with anyone else, su
lawyer or mediator?
Are there any other documents related to this case that you have received or are aware of which

could clarify the situation further?
What specific outcome are you hoping to achieve by responding to this statement?
Customer reply
There documents submitted are 1) her statement and supporting evidence that includes
negotiations held on a parenting app .2) Transcripts from a hearing. | have spoken to a Mckenzie
friend who has advised me just to tell my side. | am hoping to demonstrate to a deputy district
judge that in my understanding we hadn't already reached an agreement as | had not signed a
consent order that her solicitor drew up.

Can | see the document that you are responding to please? Please remove any personal details.

Is that the complete statement? The beginning appears to be missing and so does the end. It's
also very badly drafted. Has it come from solicitors?
The majority of court documents take the same format.Here is the format of a Witness Statement
https://www.justice.gov.uk/courts/procedure-rules/civil/standard-directions/general/witnessstatements
Yours would be in the same layout and format but it would be Respondent’s Reply to Applicants
Statement.
Please note that the Statement of Truth at the end of a witness statement has changed and here is
the new wording: https://parissmith.co.uk/blog/guidance-signing-statement-of-truth/
Whether it's a Witness Statement or Particulars of Claim or Defence or Reply to Defence or
whatever, the general layout and the format is the same along with the statement of truth and don’t 1 forget to sign and date it.

27/10/2025, 07:31 I have been served with some documents to which | must respond but | do not understand how to do it, A statement, its a
Double space each line and put an extra space between paragraphs.Number each paragraph
because it makes it easy for the court to refer to.| would normally not put more than 2 sentences
per paragraph.The paragraphs are for ease of reference, not to break the text up into subject
parts.
Refer to Claimant and Defendant throughout (or Petitioner/Respondent or Applicant/Respondent
as appropriate) and avoid he, she, they.Forget English-language construction.
The following is actually an extract from a recent order of the court.It’s in relation to a child matter
but the basic gist is still useful for any matter
https://formfinder.hmctsformfinder justice.gov.uk/c120-eng.pdfis the layout of the witness statement
| would suggest that in respect of every point you admit or deny or neither admit nor deny or have
any knowledge of everything that she is saying.|f you are denying something was missing it you
can then qualify the reply.
So for example you could say “it is admitted that the Parties met each other but the meeting was
on XYZ date instead of ABC date”.
“Itis denied that the Respondent attacked the Applicant but it is admitted that the Respondent did
raise his voice” that kind of thing.
At the beginning you say who you are and you say that you are using the same paragraph
Numbering as in the Applicants Statement.
Customer reply
| removed the names dates etc and the end bits. She does have solicitors
STUART J, Solicitor
I'm not bothered about the parties names. However there is no statement of truth at the end but
you may have removed that. | don't know whether there was anything in the rest of the first
paragraph which is relevant. Otherwise, my answers above remains the same.
STUART J, Solicitor
Can | help you any further with this?
As always, it is my pleasure to help you and | am really pleased that | was able to help yo,
far.

Customer reply
She supplied negotiations we had on a parenting app as evidence, and accused me of timewasting and wants me to pay her court fees as a result. Is there some way to make my case
without getting stuck in the weeds, as | have copious notes myself but | feel she is trying to muddy
the waters and make things more complicated than they need to be. This is the statement | sent in
at the last court ordered hearing. The judge said he would give me a chance to tell my side based
on the statement.
STUART J, Solicitor
Thank you. So you now have to reply to her statement.
Customer reply
| think you are saying | must give an answer to each point made with opposing evidence point by
point. | had hoped the fact | hadn't signed anything was enough especially given her side would
not confirm whether or not the agreement was valid - Thanks | will go back to her statement and
try and 'admit' / 'deny"
STUART J, Solicitor
It doesn't matter whether you sign anything or not. They are making the allegations and you
have to counter them. Agreements don't have to be in writing.

Hi there,

26/10/2025, 12:14 I'have filed in a EX107 in March but have not heard back from the employment tribunal This is for a preliminary hearing.
Generally it's good practice (though not always mandatory) to:
Inform the Respondent that you've applied for a transcript (via EX107).
Serve a copy of your application if the tribunal rules or judge required it.
To get an update on your case you can call or email the relevant Employment Tribunal where your
case was heard providing:
Your case number
Date of hearing
Date you submitted EX107
and Ask for a status update on your EX107 request.
& EX107 forms are processed by approved transcription companies (e.g. DRS, Epiq, Opus 2).
When you submitted EX107, you should have:
Chosen a transcription company
Possibly sent it to them as well as the tribunal
If you remember which company you selected, you can directly follow up with them as well.
If nothing works and you urgently need the transcript (for example, for an appeal or future
hearing), you can apply to the Tribunal for a Case Management Order under Rule 29 to:- Confirm
the status of the transcript
- Request a judge to direct the production of the hearing record.

Discussions between judges about a case are generaly not partof the nomal judical process, especially when it comes to individual heaith maters. The confidentiality of medical information is crucial, and judges are expected to make dedisions based on the evidence prosented in court. I you have reason 1o befiove
that the Masters in your two concurrent cases have discussed your medical feport and drawn inforences ‘about your health, you may have grounds to be concerned about the impartiaity of the proceedings.
A this point, your next steps could involve formally addressing this issue within the court systom. You may Want o raise the ssus with the court and express your concerns about the confidentialty of your medical information being discussed beween Mastars. You can consider making an application for one or both of the Masters o recuse themselves from your cases, ctig the potential breach of confidentiaiy and the

the time this time o even apply, - with two cases going on.So anyway, ths lawyer is an intenational awyer and he's often abroad Soi's been very diffcutt pinning him down and the agreement we have is | do the aratting and he does the correcting. Which isn't great, (as Im slow) - but am trying to make him do as it s possible. Soit's nota traditional barfistericlient elationship. n the past, when Ive had pro bono lawyers, they ask me questions, ask for supporiing evidence and then they draft beautiuly - which is very helpful
bocause | overthink, and overwirite everything and that's kind of where my mental health ssues fie. | wite
for a living and writng and law are very diferent discipines and | fa allhe time by overthinking legal things ‘and over compicating them. So anyway, these adjoured hearings in my absence, fesulted in los of misinformation, and assumplions that were wrong, and the Masters afttude changed siighty afterwards, and he seemed to become very expedient. Ho wanted fo get my case over and done wih as quickly as
possible. Along with the defendant, they woukin' allow the date that my counsel was avalable just two. wesks later — and they kept saying they wanted 10 get it all sorted out beforo the summer break. S0
bocause they would not wait wo weeks, | ended up on my own again as a iigant n person and that was. Very difficult for me been having to deal with stuff on my own, when | actually HAD representation, but on dates they were not amenable o.The ofher case, which i the one I've contacted you abou - is about dishonesty and concealment as | have evidenced. The other side denied that | sent them evidence of a ‘substantial lump sum raised to dlear an alleged "shortfal’. They also denied evidence of key comespondence | had sent and that money went inio the instuucted sofiitors cient account and was meant 1o pay them. Anyway | don't wanna go into those detalls right now. But the second case is what | contacted
You about. the reason | need help s | discovered in late summer this thing about my medical evidence
being discussed between the two Masters and Im not happy about tand my dodtor is also really unhappy ‘about tAnyway, the case is a compicated and difficult one because s involves dishonesty, concealment ‘and potential perury - not easy for a someone i person o figate on her own at the best of times. But 1o have incontrovertible evidence to show there has boen dishonesty. A problem is e beon very i this year. | was very ilin May and | had a lung nfection, so the master (who | Tiked biw) gave me quite along time to
prepare my stuft. know It would be sometime after the summer break in autumn because we had discussed it at the time.Then In the summor just before the break in August | had my hearing of the first
‘case againstthe defendants strkeout and although | had very strong grounds and mert, the inevitable
happened and my case was siruck out. So I've been preparing the grounds of appeal for that, and going found and round i circles a kot ever since.And the thing that has made i worse was the discovery of the medical report that my doclor wrote and carefully prepared and which the first master referred o the other
master which suggested that they talked about , | found that reall triggering. Triggering because of the amount of losses 've sustained, because of being il and absent at several hearings and unable to defend myself Anyway, the case thatis relevant today and that | need help wit is the second case, so what happencd was that the judge was pretty good and gave me ute along time in
June when 1 was clearly il with a lung infecton and | have hospita evidence to show. | also had medical ‘evidence to back it up that | had this both lung nfection and other mental health issues ke anxiety and depression and | was on anlidepressanis. So even he was a tough judge he allowed me until autum to
prepare what was pretty crucial evidence. Histoic and otherwise However because of a number ofissues that happened: | completely missed the date of that hearing. Firsty (1) my phone was stolen in July which
had my email and passwords and | didn't get any nofifications about court dates. Secondly (2) | Had ahvays received hardcopies from the defendant as well as emals. But they stopped; so | just assumed no date boen found. (3) Sadly | was very very caught up inthis unhappiness about the discovery of this medical of
my medicalinformation being discussed and iferences being drawn, and that was all 2 ind of perfect Stom.Then again, the defendant he second matter contacted my lawyer, my counsel just hree days before. the hearing to do a drop hand agreement -which | didn't want to do. And it was only then that my lawyer mentioned to me that the hearing was on the 14th of October - which compietely shocked me as | assumed thought they were st looking forfing a date, and were yet o agree. | mmediataly appiied for reff rom Sanction for a new date, just for a short tme. | explained that there were a number ofissues indluding my
phone, being stolen, and not being able o repiace theontent of t; my healthissues, and the factthat no one had told me or contacted me from out of the court o the other side and there had been no ‘communication of any kind.The intervention of the defendant on my pro bono lawyer caused him to wak ‘away from representing me, although f I'm honest, | think itis as much to do with me, not draftng things in ‘enough time which as | saidis one of my undertying issues. But i was definel affected by the defendant contacing him three days of al the hearingSo | am now trying to put together grounds of appeal for the
Second time. And I'm back to where | started. What do | o wih this iformation about my medical report which has upsot me a Iot? it has upset me to the point almost of paralysisinthe summer, and the reason being because I'velost
pretty much everything through being i, and not being presen at hearings, and a great deal of advantage: was taken of me. So for peopl 1o be discussing al the nuances and evidence of my mental and physical health issues s distutbing 1o me. And that's where you come in Martin at the moment. 'm sty s 5o longwinded and dragged out but just thought you should know as much as s necessary.

The judge notes that if you are unabie to comply by that date, you must fomally apply for further extension before January 2, 2024. There s also mention of the possibilty of Seting aside or varying the ordor within seven days of service. Your challenge may be complicated by

‘appellants access to justice leading nevitably to substantiallosses. In the context of that aone, she should
ot have had her dlaim against the respondent and struck out. Particuarly as the allegations of ishonesty ‘and concealment against the fourth defendant were so serious. The appeliant dd everything with her power to make good service, including paying for a courer n Bristol, and making sure that he defvered it porsonally, and marking the envelope, ‘private and confidenta’ There was nothing more the appellant could have done in the cicumstances. To dismiss this partof a claim was both misguided and wrong in law.Ground 3. Failure of communication
“The Judge overiooked the fact tha the appellant had heard nothing ffom the cout or espondent for a
prolonged period prir o the hearing. she feceived neiher emal communication nor hard copy corespondence m. This was not considered, resulfing in a lack of clariy for the appeliant regarding her representation for the hearing date Ground 4. Loss of representation “The judge ered by not granting an extansion ofime or adjoumment upon knawing the appelant fost pro. bono representation, shorty after the respondent making contact with him, leading to nequalty of amns and Genying her a fair opportunity.Ground 5. CPRIA Vunerabilty’ No need 1o charge himself classiied appelant as ‘winerable' under CPR1A. Yet failed to accommodate i
Falure to acknowledge the appolants vuinerabilty under CPR 1A and her documented medical diffcultes
particularly in a heightened tension of having had her phone stolen, and having missed the date, amounted 1o procedural imeguiaity. The judge also failed to considerfignored two recent compelling documents with crucial evidence related o the appellants lving conditions, constitutng a futher procedural imegularity.Ground 6.

herself propery. “The appelant especialy in view ofjust losing her counsel, was dlearly disacvantaged by the late delvery of the bundie ust days before the hearing, and also in late Seplember . Even if the hearing date had not been missed, the appelant would have boen entiled to an adjournment as the bundie, presented the day before! and at some point in September. This was simply too it time afforded for her to process the inormation
‘and caselaw, something she had made dlear previously. This was a procedural iegularity.Ground 7.The
judge erred in his insistence on oral vidence instead of granting a urther short adjourment “This was confusing to the appellant and aso prevented important detal from being communicated. Moreover, the judge's approach in assuming certain aspects of the case without full cons~deration or ‘documentary evidence undermines the fundamental princples of procedural faimess. The atmosphere created during the hearing resembled that of a trialrather than an impartial and objective assessment o the
‘grounds presented for consideration. ‘Addiionally,the failure to provide adequate ime 1o review case materials n @ complex mater was misguided. The failre to consider crucial eidence inthis way was both wrong in aw and a procedural iegularity. This signiicanty impacted the faimess of the proceedings and made a fair tial ipossible in the circumstances.Ground 8. The Judge erred in neglecting to consider alterative dispute fesolution methods s away forward in he fiigation.

Towards the end of Juy the appelant's mobi phone was stolen fom a cafe where she was working. Despie the phone being located o an address in Lewisham, the poice were unable {0 cblain a warrant o search the private property.Recovery was a time-consuming process: Recovering the lost data from the Stolen phone was a lengthy and challenging process for the appellant. She was unable to fetreve important documents, drats, notes, caselaw, and her allocated email address forthe claim due to ot having the.
passwords. Recovery s il incompete.Lack of communiation: “There was no email correspondence or hard copies sent fom either the court or the respondent for almost fve months. The appelant was unaware of the court date as there was no contact fom ether party. The respondent had been communicaing solely with the pro bono barrister assisting the appelant, without her knowledge. The appeliant had been used to receiving at the very least hardcopies by post fom both court ‘and respondent. She appreciates that the respondent may not have been ‘required' to includs herin comespondance, once in contact with her counsel, but tis easonabie to expect that important information
ke dates, should have been shared with al parties involied, and by hard copy. It would also have been wise and prudent for the fespondent to nform her that they would no longer be contacting her directy whilst ‘communicating with her counsel. But this did not happen.Ongoing ey and vision issues: The appelant has explained mulipl times of an autoimmune conditon that causes ongoing eyesight and vision problems. This condition often leads to her ‘missing detalls and affects her abiity 1o ead and see
properly when it has flared up o an excessive or uncomfortable degreeLate nofificaton from counsel: “The appelant was not aware of any fixed dates for the hearing unti a couple of days before. She had received no natification including from her barrster unt the lastfow days. They had communicated briefl,
but at ross purposes. Her counsel thought she was aware and did not mention the date untia couple of
days before. The appellant i turn, assumed it had not yet been fixed because it had not been referred to by counsal; whowas largely discussing recent contract made by the respondent. She was deeply shocked to then ind out ha the hearing was just days away. She may have boen copied i or tod earlier on, butfor whatever reason it had not ‘registered on her. She just believed that there was a date that nesded o be frmed up past Septomber 2023, This miscommunication: - one of the documented issues the appellant has
referred 1o when discussing CPR 1A - led the appeliant to believe thatthe date had notyet boen
fxedInvolvement n another urgent matter: “The appelant was simutaneously deeply immersed in another matter that required her full attention, and. that had disclosed dificut information that had affected her abily o ligate. Without a fixed date for the. hearing, she priorfised condluding the other mater first,
(Contnued). Seriousness Of Case. Moreover on the seriousness and gravity of the allegations of ishonesty and concealment alone, and within the case fsef, - the learned Judge should have allowed a short extension of time. There was no
timetable, no tralor speific dates that the appellants oversight affected. It did not cause prejudice o the respondent. And the appellant should not have be deprived of an opportuniy 1o progress such an mportant ‘caseThess circumstances, when considered together, were an unusual and regretiable, perfoct storn’ ~
that significanty impacted the appelants abilty to prepare adequately for the hearing. Her reasons were
genuine, regretiable,and based on a series of events that culminated in the missed hearing date. The. judge's failure o recognise and evaluate these factors constituted an erforof law and fed o the procedural imegularity and ulimately an unfair ral in the appelants case.
GROUND 2
Inadequate nolice regarding the case bundie hindered the appellants abity to defend herself properly. “The appelant, especialyin view ofjust losing her counsel, was dlearl cisacvantaged by the late delvery of the bundle ust days before the hearing, and aiso apparently inlate Seplember.

On this basis alone, the judge should have allowed a short adjournment “The judge ered by not granting an extansion of ime or adjoumment upon knawing the appelant was now without represantation, leading to inequality of arms and denying the appellant a fair opportunity.

I your case, you can seek cooperation from Social Setvices through the court in two key ways. Firsl, you can request speciic documentsn your court bundle, such as previous assessments, police reporls, and ‘communication with other professionals. This wil provide necessary information for addressing accusations in your judicial review. Second, you can ask for an adjourment of the assessment due 1o health reasons ‘and focus on preparing forthe judicial review. Poliely deine the assessment, explain your situation, and

Lawyer: JD Law
“Their responses serve as a valuable foundation for bulding your case fo the judicial feview. Here's a ‘summary of their answers and how you can leverage them:Key Points to Strengthen Your Case: 1. Cannabis Allegation: Their nabilty o confirm the source or any invesiigation weakens their rationale for
the Child Protection Plan (CPP) 2. Police Entry: They shift responsibilty to the police. Consider requesting disciosure of relevant police records from the June 16ih incident. Your "Leter Before Claim” reflects your atiempt o resolve the stuation through legal channels.
3. Justiication for Inervention: They emphasize theirduty to safequard chikren. You can challenge ths by arguing that their actions, such as forced entry and repeated vsits, caused undue stress that could hamn
Your chidren's wel-being. 4. Biological Father Misiformation: Acknowledgement of the erfor and commitment o update the record
highlights potentialinaccuracies in ther report. 5. Objectivy: Their response lacks specific examples, raising doubls about the impartiaty o their ‘assessments. Additonal Points for the Court Bundie: - Include copies of your correspondence requesting information and their esponses. - Ifyou have medical records documenting your health issues, consider ncluding them with necessary
privacy redactions. - Include any evidence that contradics thefrclaims, such as feceipts for home improvements.Focus on the.
Judicial Review:
Whie these responses offe valuable insights, prioritize completing your court bundie for the judiial reviow. ‘Concentrate on disproving the accusations and demonsirating that the CPP was implemented without
proper justiication. Is there anyihing specific you need assistance with as you prepare for the judicil review?

Hello Lea.
My name is’ need to appeal against a decision of East London Family court's order regarding
the custody of my children. | need to know the process of appeal. | used to be on Legal Aid, |
discharged my lawyer, they did not represent me well. This legal battle lasts already for 2.5 years.
The Court took CAFCASS recommendation. CAFCASS officer took my ex-husband viewpoint and
disregarded my children's wishes. My children went to GP to seek reconciliation with me, the GP
confirmed that.

26/10/2025, 11:56 I need to appeal a court decision re children custody. | also suffered domestic abuse
What was the order made?
Customer reply
Hi Lea,
The order is not made yet. On the hearing the judge said she will issue a variation order, meaning
she will take the last order and vary it a little. The last order was that | can see children in contact
centre with supervision. Now the judge allowed the contact to move into "community" supervised
by a person agreed by both parents. | wanted 100% custody based on my children visited the GP
asking to help with reconciliation. This is major development, until that the father told to the court
that children dont want to see me. So, the father (resident parent and my ex-husband) lied to the
court
SASH_LAW, Lawyer
An order is made at the hearing - so the judge has already decided to vary the order and give the
father contact in the community, is that correct?
Is that what you are wanting to appeal?
Customer reply
Hi Lea,
The order was made against me. My ex was a lawyer in the past and he knew how to act. So, he
put a NMO against me while | was in hospital. So, | try to dispute the order for the last 2.5 years

26/10/2025, 11:56 I need to appeal a court decision re children custody. | also suffered domestic abuse
And that is what you wish to appeal?
Customer reply
correct
SASH_LAW, Lawyer
You can only appeal an order if the judge made an error of fact, law or procedure. You don't
appear to be saying the judge made an error of one of these things, but if you think he/she did,
then what you need to do to appeal is set out below.
To appeal you need form N161, and you will be required to order a transcript of the hearing you
are appealing, produce your grounds of appeal (what errors of fact, law or procedure the judge
made), and a skeleton argument detailing the law that you are seeking to rely on to support the
grounds of appeal.
Appealing is difficult and it is very likely you will need a solicitor to go over the transcript for you
to see if there are in fact grounds to appeal the decision. Be aware that if you lose, you may be
asked to pay the other side’s costs.
You can find a solicitor here: solicitors.lawsociety.org.uk
You will need form EX107 to obtain the transcript, and the notes to help you complete that form.

Lea,
While being married, | suffered a domestic abuse which | was not aware of before. My ex-husband
was abusing me heating me in the head. | did not recall most of it until | started to write witness
statement and had gaps in my memory. | went to GP with a stiff neck and the GP said that | have a
"dowager hump", which is an evidence of domestic abuse. How can | use it to fight for my
children?
On the last hearing | provided the GP statement to the court. But the judge did not pursue it.
Can you suggest how can | use this to fight for my children

The inaccuracies in the transcript can be added as a ground of appeal. You could argue for

If your grounds have already been filed you would need to file supplemental grounds of appeal.

Good evening and thank you for your question. I'm a partner in a law firm specialising in family law
and dispute resolution so I'd be happy to offer some guidance on this matter.
I'll need a little more information to fully answer your question.
First and foremost, do you have a copy of the order you can upload? If necessary, please redact
any personal info.
Secondly, what was drafted incorrectly? Have you signed the order?
Why have the court directed a banning order against you?
Customer reply

The Christmas dates were supposed to be with dad in Xmas Eve until 11am on Xmas day and
then with me until 18.00 on Boxing Day, not Xmas day. This was from our last court order and
hadn’t been changed in this order. The only thing changed was news years.The banning order was

Hello again. Were these dates actually discussed in court? Were you not sent a copy of the draft
order before it was filed with the court?
Customer reply
Neither of us were represented so the legal advisor in the hearing wrote the order and posted it to
us. Xmas dates were never an issue only new years. The times are right, just should be until
Boxing Day at 18.00 not Xmas day.
This is the only copy we are sent
Was heard by the magistrates
JEREMYT1020, Solicitor
In the first instance, you need to write to the other side's solicitor and reiterate your dates. If they
are not willing to agree to the amended times/days, you may have to appeal. As it was a
magistrates' court that heard the matter, you cannot obtain a transcript as the hearings in
magistrates' courts are never recorded.
If you appeal the order, please bear in mind there is a strict time limit of 21 days to lodge your
appeal. If the other side are unco-operative over changing the date voluntarily, you will probably
have to threaten them with the appeal.
Customer reply
Thank you for your reply.l was under the impression that the family court hearings were recorded
no matter what court they were heard in so | now believe I'm stuck.
My ex is very controlling but has flipped it on me to make out | am. He is still refusing to
communicate even though the judge ordered him to. | have asked him to agree the dates are
wrong but | am getting ignored as usual. He doesn’t have a solicitor.
It has always been that he has all of xmas eve and me xmas day and boxing day as he doesn’t
celebrate xmas day. Obviously he now won't agree to change this as he knows it is upsetting for
me.The order was made on 21st May and | received the order 2 weeks ago. | have been writing to
the court regarding this and what | have to do to get it amended but also no reply.
| don't think | can appeal now | am banned.
Customer reply
What form will | need to lodge an appeal? | am only appealing as the order is different to what was
agreed in court. This is a mistake in the wording. It's not that | didn’t agree to what the judge
agreed in court. 1

i \vill still have to consider your appeal even if there is a section 91 in place. This is
because, whilst a section 91 is meant to prevent 'frivolous' applications, to blanket ban a genuine

26/10/2025, 12:01 I'was in family court for a directions hearing yesterday after a S7 report recommended a Fact Finding and no interim
Judge said that because it will be a 4 day FFH that it will likely be next summer so set up contact in
the interim.. against CAFCASS recommendation. | feel CAFCASS took all this into consideration
and against mine and Dad's suggestions of supervised, recommended no interim. Having read the
S7 and how significant the abuse would have been even at their young age, | agree with
CAFCASS that not even Supervised is safe.
SASH_LAW, Family Lawyer
Did the judge order the supervised contact without your agreement?
SASH_LAW, Family Lawyer
That's quite an unusual stance to take.
Did the judge fully explain their reasons for going against cafcass' recommendations?
Customer reply
They commented that in the S7 interview | agreed to supervised.. but a lot more has happened
since and his lies are very concerning
Just said it was because of the time frame. But | believe that CAFCASS knew this as even to me
said it would be a considerable length of time.
SASH_LAW, Family Lawyer
Are you concerned that the father will be directly abusive to the child?
Customer reply
| believe that the Supervised helps negate that part of the abuse, but not other aspects. And not
against the rest of the family. He is destroying me emotionally and I'm barely hanging on, this will
be too much. Their siblings cried, Dad has a son from another relationship who was planning on
refusing contact if he didn't get contact with my child as they don't want anything to do with Dad,
but had said they will keep going to protect toddler ifiwhen unsupervised is granted.

Is your question today then, whether or not you may have grounds for appeal?
Customer reply
how to go about it. Indirect is for 6 weeks (3x cards) then direct contact, so not sure how much
time | have.
SASH_LAW, Family Lawyer
What level of judge made the order - a district judge or a circuit judge?
Customer reply
| don't know. It was in County court
SASH_LAW, Family Lawyer
You can only appeal an order if the judge made an error of fact, law or procedure. You must
appeal an interim judgment within 7 days. If you are late, or out of time to appeal, you must
apply for permission to appeal, which you do on the same form as your substantive appeal.
An appeal from magistrates or district judge goes to the circuit judge at the same court.
To appeal you need form N161, and you will be required to order a transcript of the hearing you
are appealing, produce your grounds of appeal (what errors of fact, law or procedure the judge
made), and a skeleton argument detailing the law that you are seeking to rely on to support the
grounds of appeal.
Appealing is difficult and it is very likely you will need a solicitor to go over the transcript for you
to see if there are in fact grounds to appeal the decision. Be aware that if you lose, you may be
asked to pay the other side’s costs.
Form N161 and notes to help you complete it are here:

Customer reply
| have Legal aid, but assume they wont support this appeal
What costs will the other side have? Do you mean if this does go back to court? They are self
representing.
SASH_LAW, Family Lawyer
Yes, legal fees.
If self representing, then they may not have legal fees - but for an appeal, lots of people instruct
a lawyer.
Legal Aid will only support an appeal if they are sure you have a good chance of success.
Customer reply
Hmm he might just to occur costs...
My solicitor a very lack lustre, so don't think they would support anything
SASH_LAW, Family Lawyer
It's more about whether there are actual grounds to appeal or not. If the judge made an interim
order regarding contact whilst ignoring cafcass recommendations, they would have to fully
explain that - if they did not, then that may be grounds for appeal as it would be an error.
But | am going by what you have said - your solicitor, or whoever represented you in court, will
be the one who can tell you if there was in fact an error made that is worthwhile appealing on.

Yes, as | said, it looks like there is at least one ground - but only your solicitor can determine
that as they have all the facts from the hearing.
Customer reply
Which they wont talk to me about if LA don't cover it... so what do | do if they won't help me but are
the only people who can?
SASH_LAW, Family Lawyer
They will talk to you about whether you have grounds for appeal - LAA won't be involved until
they say yes or no...if your solicitors say there are no grounds, or no prospect of success, you'll

Good afternoon,
1. Can you provide more information about the specific procedures that should have been followed
in the court's recording system?
2. Have you received any formal explanation or apology from the court regarding their failure to
use the manual backup system?
3. How does not having a transcript of the hearing put you at a severe disadvantage in your
appeal?
STUART J, Solicitor
Hello again.
| see that you have not had a chance to get back to me with the information | requested. It would
really help me if | had the full background please.
Based on the limited information provided, let me answer you as far as | can at this stage in time.

continue this thread until all your queries are answered.
Meanwhile.....
You can complain about the lack of transcript and follow-up and procedures but it's not going to
actually do you any good.
All'you can do therefor is rely on your handwritten notes and submit those as evidence of what
was said and agreed.lt really is as simple as that.
Customer reply
Good afternoon Stuart. I'm at work so I've not been able to respond. 1. It is my understanding that
HM Courts & Tribunals Service's (HMCTS's) guidance to staff in March 2011 instructed all courts
to carry out frequent checks on recording equipment. This clearly was not undertaken by
Middlesborough. 2. | have received correspondence (at the 4th time of asking) which does include
an apology from the court but no explanation other than they had not realised that the recording
equipment wasn't working and that because no one realised, they hadn't reverted to a manual

Customer reply
It is my intention to complain formally about the the inability to obtain a recording and therefore a
transcript. It defies logic and fairness that complaining won't do any good but thanks for letting me
know that you believe it wouldn't. Unfortunately handwritten notes can not be backed with
evidence - for example the judge at the hearing was contacted 3 days prior to the hearing by me to
explain that | hadn't received the claimant's bundle. The judge stated at the hearing that he had
received my email but had decided to proceed only to later clearly demonstrate that he had clearly
not read the email as he asked me to refer to a particular page in the claimant's bundle and was
then astounded that | couldn't as | had never received the claimant's bundle. He then stated that
the claimant was in breach of the court order and was minded to halt the hearing but after 3 or so
minutes stated that since we were all there and that despite the fact that | hadn't received the
bundle he was sure that I'd probably seen most of it at some point and he proceeded anyway
(asking me to spend my lunch hour making myself familiar with the claimant's 100 plus page
bundle). | can state that in writing but since there is no recording and therefore no transcript, |
cannot prove it other than to provide evidence of the email that | sent to the judge ahead of the
hearing.
STUART J, Solicitor
| hear everything that you say and | cannot disagree with you.
Your complaint however will not resolve it.
Handwritten notes cannot be backed with evidence but if you can prove that they were done at the
time, the court is likely to accept it.
Although there may not be a transcript the judges notes would be taken as gospel.Judges make
copious notes.Your email is also good evidence because that’s prior to the hearing.Remember that
things only have to be decided on the balance of probabilities, more likely than not.So all you need
to do is tip the balance in your favour you have enough evidence to do that.
Does that all make sense now whether or not it's the answer you wanted and whether or not is the
answer which you expected.?
Have | answered all your questions for you?
If you have any further queries or need any clarification, | am happy to answer any specific points
arising from this.
Please don't hesitate to ask.

Customer reply
Thank you Stuart. It would seem that if the judge's notes are taken as gospel then anything | note
is irrelevant. Forgive me for saying this but some judges have very large egos and | cannot see
this judge stating that he two very significant mistakes, one | can only prove with a transcript, the
other in permitting the hearing to proceed having been notified ahead of the hearing (and again at
the hearing) that the claimant had not followed the court order and had not shared their evidence,
leaving me to answer questions relating to evidence | was seeing for the first time at the hearing.
Again, thank you for your advice. Incidentally, there are no 5 starts at the top of my page.
STUART J, Solicitor
No need to apologise for making your comments about the judges. | couldn't agree more.| have
known judges accept evidence on the day without allowing the other person to take legal advice
on the effect and have known other judges disallow it because it was a day late. No consistency.
To my mind, a miss is as good as a mile and of its daylight it's not allowed otherwise there is no
point in having the court order in the first place.
Sometimes the star rating doesn't crop up but thank you anyway.

You are out of time to appeal it at this stage - you would have had 21 days from the date of the
hearing to do so.
What you should do now is challenge the cafcass report and focus on how to ask the judge for
the level of contact you would like.
You could apply to appeal out of time, but that is a high hurdle to get over, and if | am honest
with you, the reasons you gave above do not appear to reach the level required to actually

SASH_LAW, Family Lawyer
In that case you won't need to obtain permission to appeal as an appeal from magistrates is
automatic.
But you still need grounds on which to appeal.
You can only appeal an order if the magistrates made an error of fact, law or procedure. You
must appeal an interim judgment within 7 days, and a final judgment within 21 days of the
hearing. If you are late, or out of time to appeal, you must apply for permission to appeal, which
you do on the same form as your substantive appeal. 0

To appeal you need form N161, and you will be required to order a transcript of the hearing you
are appealing, produce your grounds of appeal (what errors of fact, law or procedure the judge
made), and a skeleton argument detailing the law that you are seeking to rely on to support the
grounds of appeal.
Appealing is difficult and it is very likely you will need a solicitor to go over the transcript for you
to see if there are in fact grounds to appeal the decision. Be aware that if you lose, you may be
asked to pay the other side’s costs.
Form N161 and notes to help you complete it are here:
https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/form-n161-appellants-notice-all-appeals-exceptsmall-claims-track-appeals-and-appeals-to-the-family-division-of-the-high-court
You can find a solicitor here: solicitors.lawsociety.org.uk
You will need form EX107 to obtain the transcript, and the notes to help you complete that form.

You do only have 21 days to appeal, and you have to do quite a lot in order to get to that stage -
and the first point would be for your barrister to say whether you have grounds to do so.

Its been through the adjudicator. The university fid, the OIA (ihe Offce of the Independent Adjudicator) led. They acted dishonestly. 1 have written evidence for . Infact, the way in which both the University and the OIA acted is part and parcel of the allsged harassrment. 1 have done quite a bt of work in the background, | ©ad documents . 1 6id sond them a leter before action. The university tokd me 10 go 1o the OIA. the OIA said they do not investigate mattars of whather laws have been breached. So, the university made me waste my time for
nothing, only to make me waste more time. Correction: "So, the universty made me go o the OIA for nothing, only to make me waste time.” 1250 wrote more than one complaint against harassment o the unversity. They have been leaving it unsolved for years, while atthe same ime they maintain they followed their procedures elc o putitin

the university to deal with my complaints properly (honestly, without ignoring evidence etc) shouid say there are ample and detailed documentation (regulations the university has to abide by) regarding how to deal with complaints. The universiy has just boen (effectvely) refusing to abide by i This has occurred in roughly three ways: (1) not dealing with some of my complaints at al (2) dealing with some other complaints
dishonestly, &.g., prefending i was not a problem in spite o evidence given (3) in yet some other cases, by ealing with the compiaint properly but, afer upholing it they didn' do anything i terms of ropars, as f
othing big had happened bu, nstead, they just gave verbal apologies that amount to nothing in terms of epairs(they are even modking finsuling, considering the Grcumstance). Ifs like (for example) someone has committed arson to a house, or (another example) a car accident, and when the party Who is
responsible,instead of paying damages for the bumt house ! for the damaged car,say -upon being investigated and found guity “oh, sorry". And then they tellyou that they “solvedr the situation because they ‘apologised. In some ofher cases, the universiy also deleted evidence and / of refuses 1o isclose it otc There are ofher Variations 1o how the university deal with compiaint, but mainly the above threo categories
(1)not dealing with complaints at al 2)dealing withthem dishonestly (including but not by far limited 1o deleting evidence or blocking my access it 3)doing things properly up tohe point where the complaint s upheld, but then giving a verbal apology that ‘amounts to nothing. 1 would lke to emphasize again that there are ample, detaled regulations of how to deal with complaints 5o it should be something very siraightfonvard for the court to order the university (via injunction) to ust ollow those reguiations in practice

Hi, Im Lea and | have reviewed your query. You say ‘courtjudgment for divorce' - do you mean a finandial order? Please bear in mind this is an email service and not a e chat so responses may nol be instanianeous. | ‘am not available for cals but in all cases i very kel you can be helped anline.

] HiLea. Yes | probably do. Its the last bit after all the points the judge has considered and decides on pension sharing etc Regards John

Whatis it that you think the judge got wrong?
‘Ask Your Own Family Law Question
o My husband and | had a business. The Judge decided that the business was profitable enough to support me. Unfortunately the figures she used are costs, not profis. I'm justlooking for advice as 1o approach the
‘Courtto convey this error. Are there any specifc forns o letters to do thisRegards John
L J———
Ifyou feel the judge got something wrong, that s a mater or appeal, though you could approach the judge via an application o ask herto review thelr decision n the ightof the ermor you beiieve she has made. “The second option s done wia an application on a form D11, which you can find here Titpsiiassets. publishing service. gov.ukigovernmentivw2:-secure.ustanswer comistatic/-
‘gqalatiachmentimg-locked.svg You can also ask, f the judge refuses 1o amend the order, for pormission to appeal (see below). “The second is done via an appication to appeal on a form N161, which is found here: ttpsihww govukigovernmentipublicationsfform-n161-appelants nofice-allappeas-except-smalk claims- rack appeals-and-app eals-1o-the-famil-division-of-he-high-court The link also provides a urtherlink o
quidance on how 1o complete the form. Appeals have to be made within 21 days of the judgment, and in theory you needed the permission of the. judge to do so, butn the absence of that, you can also use the same fomn 1o apply for permission to appeal - or 0 apply for permission to appeal out of time if you are outside the 21 days.
Appealing s a difficult process, and | would suggest you instruct soliciors o assst you. Does that assist?
