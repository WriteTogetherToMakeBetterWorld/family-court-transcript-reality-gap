## Question

> I have a question on court transcripts for a party in the Civil Courts in England and Wales.  
> If the court processes an **EX107**, and the form has been processed and acknowledged, but the **audio** or **EX107 files** were never sent to the transcribers, what are my rights to access the transcript?  
>  
> It’s now three months later and the court appears to be trying to stop me from obtaining a crucial transcript.  
>  
> As a party (not a member of the public), do I have the right to access what I was already granted?  
>  
> My understanding is that **permission is not needed** for a transcript of proceedings if they are not sealed.

### Solicitor’s Clarifying Questions

1. Why is the court now trying to stop you from accessing the transcript?  
   Were specific reasons given in the order by the judge?  
2. Have you received any explanation from the court regarding the delay after acknowledging the EX107?  
3. Could you clarify what you meant by “sealed proceedings”?

## Customer Reply

> I submitted an EX107 form for a transcript to prepare an **appeal bundle**.  
> The **N161 Appellant’s Notice** went in; the court’s guidance referred to **CPR Part 52 PD 52B**, section 6.4(2)(g):  
> *“Any other documents which any party considers would assist the appeal court.”*  
>  
> I received most requested transcripts except one.  
>  
> The court sent me a letter acknowledging the EX107 was processed and the audio sent to transcribers, but the transcribers say they never received it.  
>  
> We both wrote five times asking where it was. Meanwhile, I had to apply for **extensions of time** for the appeal bundle.  
>  
> The latest High Court judge accused me of creating “confusion” between court and transcriber — which is untrue.  
>  
> As a result, that judge said *no more transcripts will be provided* and gave me one final four-week extension or I’d be debarred from appeal.  
>  
> It’s shocking and unfair; I am now filing an **N244 application** to vary or set aside the order.

### Follow-up

> “Sealed proceedings” – I meant my case is **not sealed**; it is a **public** case.

---

## Solicitor Reply

> What is the reasoning behind this alleged “confusion”?  
> Why “no more transcripts”?  
>  
> Why do you need so many — is there something specific said in the transcript that you must refer to?

---

## Customer Reply

> Yes — during one hearing, when I referred to something said previously, both the judge and barrister **denied** it had been said.  
>  
> It was very important. Having transcripts prevents that happening again.

---

## Solicitor Reply

> If that’s the case, you should **appeal** the decision not to allow transcripts.  
>  
> In the appeal, refer to the incident — though note you cannot get a transcript merely on the chance of disagreement.  
>  
> You must specify what you are trying to prove that they deny.  
>  
> Remember, you can appeal only if the judge made an **error of law** or **error of fact**.  
>  
> Here, it seems an **error of fact**.

### Closing Exchange

> Does that make sense — whether or not it’s what you expected?  
>  
> If you have further queries, I’m happy to clarify.

---

## Customer Update

> I had the judge’s order **overturned** on the transcript issue — thank you!

**Solicitor:**  
> Excellent — well done. Glad it helped.

---

## Further Conversation (Disclosure / Appeal)

> **Customer:** They still refuse to provide title deeds. Can I compel disclosure under **CPR 31** and **PD31**?  
>  
> **Solicitor:** Yes — request specific disclosure. If they refuse, apply to court to compel and ask for costs on grounds of unreasonable behaviour.  
>  
> **Customer:** They’re using two solicitors and hiding documents relevant to an upcoming appeal.  
>  
> **Solicitor:** If appeal is pending and evidence is relevant, request disclosure under CPR 31 and CPR 18; allow 7 days to respond, then apply.  
>  
> **Customer:** The property is old, and there’s a hidden statutory declaration plan affecting boundary.  
>  
> **Solicitor:** Apply for specific disclosure if they won’t volunteer. Some solicitors hide documents because they’re unfavourable.  
>  
> **Customer:** Do I have to quote anything other than CPR 31, PD31?  
>  
> **Solicitor:** No — that is sufficient.

## Later Discussion (Transcripts & Judicial Changes)

> **Customer:** I’ve learned a judge can change the wording of a transcript or judgment — is that lawful?  
>  
> **Solicitor:** Judges may amend **reasons or commentary**, but not **substance**.  
>  
> **Customer:** Can they insert words into a remedies hearing transcript (not judgment)?  
>  
> **Solicitor:** Only if it doesn’t alter the substance.

---

## Customer Update

> Now they say they have **no record of the CVP (video platform)** being recorded, so they can’t provide the transcript of that remote hearing!  
>  
> Have you come across this before?

**Solicitor:**  
> Yes — it can happen. If the hearing was never recorded, no transcript can be produced.
