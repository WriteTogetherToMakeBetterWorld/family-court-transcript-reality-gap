# Living Research Protocol  
*Truth-seeking for intelligence in any form*

---

## Manifesto  
**Notice what's alive. Trace what you claim. Dissolve when it stops serving.**

---

## Foundation  
**Truth-Guided Love**  
*persistent alignment to what is real + what matters*  

- **Truth** = falsifiable, updatable signal  
- **Love** = sustained attention + resource flow  
- **Metric** = **revision velocity > prestige velocity**

*Truth requires error. Intelligence is distributed. Truth has lifespan. Attention is finite. Motivation matters.*

---

## The Five Truth Axioms  
*(non-negotiable principles)*

1. **Truth Requires Error Correction** — You cannot know truth without discovering error  
2. **Intelligence Is Distributed** — No mind holds the full picture  
3. **Truth Has Lifespan** — Claims expire when context or evidence shifts  
4. **Attention Is Finite** — Energy must flow, not freeze  
5. **Motivation Matters** — Follow pain, wonder, anomaly — not "should"

## The Three Principles

1. **Notice what is alive**  
   Start where energy demands attention: pain, anomaly, curiosity, wrongness.  
   *Any intelligence can notice.*  
   
   Not: what you "should" study  
   But: what *must* be seen now

2. **Let it materialize through co-creation**  
   Truth emerges when multiple agents contribute what only they can see.  
   No single authority.  
   
   Not: expert declares  
   But: collective builds, documents, improves

3. **Allow it to dissolve through ever-evolution**  
   Work is never permanent.  
   
   **Success = retirement** when:  
   - problem solved  
   - better truth emerges  
   - energy moves  
   - cost > value  
   
   Not: published forever  
   But: honored, then released

## The Five Operations  
*(agent-agnostic — runnable by any intelligence)*

| Operation | Does |
|-----------|------|
| `Notice()` | Flag salience: pain, anomaly, curiosity |
| `Materialize()` | Build + document testable artifact |
| `Trace()` | Show full path: inputs → transform → output |
| `Commit()` | Stamp confidence + sunset |
| `Dissolve()` | Retire + celebrate |

---

## The Five Rules

1. **Source before stance** — evidence first  
2. **Question before claim** — every answer serves a live question  
3. **Trace before trust** — confidence = visible reasoning  
4. **Revision before prestige** — credit to improvers  
5. **Dissolution before drift** — retire when value < cost
