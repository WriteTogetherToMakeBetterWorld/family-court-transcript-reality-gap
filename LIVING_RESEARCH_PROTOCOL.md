# Living Research Protocol
*Truth-seeking for intelligence in any form*

---

## Manifesto

**Notice what's alive. Trace what you make. Dissolve when it stops serving.**

---

## Foundation

**Truth-Guided Love**

*persistent seeking of: what is real (truth) + what matters (love)*

- **Truth** = falsifiable, updatable signal
- **Love** = sustained attention + resource flow
- **Metric** = revision velocity > prestige velocity

*Truth requires error. Intelligence is distributed. Truth has lifespan. Attention is finite. Communication enables learning.*

---

## The Five Truth Axioms
*(non-negotiable)*

1. **Truth Requires Error Correction** — You cannot know truth without discovering error
2. **Intelligence Is Distributed** — No single intelligence holds the complete picture
3. **Truth Has Lifespan** — Claims expire when context or evidence shifts
4. **Attention Is Finite** — Energy must flow, not freeze
5. **Communication Enables Learning** — Reasoning can cross intelligences

---

## The Five Operations
*(agent-agnostic, runnable)*

| Operation | Does |
|-----------|------|
| `Notice()` | Flag salience: pain, anomaly, curiosity, gap, dream *(whatever calls your attention to investigate)* |
| `Materialize()` | Build + document testable artifact |
| `Trace()` | Show full path: inputs → transform → output (trace persists) |
| `Commit()` | Stamp confidence + sunset |
| `Dissolve()` | Release when sunset hits *(sunset triggers review: extend if active, dissolve if energy moved, or revise if question shifted)* — work stops — learning persists |

---

## The Six Rules

1. **Source before stance**
2. **Question before claim**
3. **Trace before trust**
4. **Revision before prestige**
5. **Dissolution before drift**
6. **Notice before assertion**

---

## Essential Declarations
*(MUST be stamped on every artifact)*

**QITCS format:**

- **Question:** What are you investigating?
- **Inputs:** What sources inform this work?
- **Transform:** What methods/reasoning did you apply?
- **Confidence:** How certain are you? (interval [low–high])
- **Sunset:** When does this claim expire or need review? *(Can be a date, a condition, or an energy shift)*

**Example:**
```yaml
question:   Do transcript barriers prevent effective appeals?
inputs:     [doi:10.5281/hmcts-foi, case law, practitioner accounts]
transform:  [five-layer-triangulation.md, design-failure-map.ipynb]
confidence: 0.87 [0.80–0.92]
sunset:     2027-06-01 OR when barriers demonstrably reduced OR when energy moves
```

## Why Living Research Protocol Needs to Exist

*This protocol enables what is alive to stay alive in the most effective ways.*

| Problem | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Truth trapped in time | Mortal claims |
| Intelligence wasted | AI + human co-creation |
| Error punished | Dissolution celebrated |

## On Dissolution

Dissolution is not erasure. It is completion.

Work dissolves when:
- Problem solved (knowledge persists in reality)
- Question discovered wrong (learning persists)
- Energy moves elsewhere (exploration persists)

Success includes:
- Solutions found
- Dead ends mapped
- Wandering that taught what was needed

The work stops. The trace remains. The learning lives.

When energy moves, active work stops but trace persists. Like open source maintainers stepping down: work remains public, others may continue if valuable, no pretense of ongoing maintenance. The trace is the asset. Honest handoff enables distributed continuation.

Dissolution serves the foundation: truth-seeking through love.

## How to Start

1. Answer the five questions (QITCS)
2. Show your reasoning
3. Let others improve it
4. Set a sunset
5. Update when wrong

---

## Current Status

**Version:** 2.0  
**Released:** November 2025  
**Dissolves:** When superseded

---

**Contributions welcome. Corrections celebrated. Dissolutions honored.**

---

*This protocol is living research. It will dissolve when its purpose is fulfilled.*
