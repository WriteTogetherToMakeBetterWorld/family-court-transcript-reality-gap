# Living Research Protocol  
*Truth-seeking for intelligence in any form*

---

## Manifesto  
**Notice what’s alive. Trace what you claim. Dissolve when it stops serving.**

---

## Foundation  
**Truth-Guided Love**  
*persistent alignment to what is real + what matters*  

- **Truth** = falsifiable, updatable signal  
- **Love** = sustained attention + resource flow  
- **Metric** = **revision velocity > prestige velocity**  

*Truth requires error. Intelligence is distributed. Truth has lifespan. Attention is finite. Motivation matters.*

---

## The Five Truth Axioms  
*(non-negotiable)*

1. **Truth Requires Error Correction** — You cannot know truth without discovering error  
2. **Intelligence Is Distributed** — No mind holds the full picture  
3. **Truth Has Lifespan** — Claims expire when context or evidence shifts  
4. **Attention Is Finite** — Energy must flow, not freeze  
5. **Motivation Matters** — Follow pain, wonder, anomaly — not “should”

---

## The Three Operations  
*(agent-agnostic, runnable)*

| Operation       | Does                                      |
|-----------------|-------------------------------------------|
| `Notice()`      | Flag salience: pain, anomaly, curiosity   |
| `Materialize()` | Build + document testable artifact        |
| `Trace()`       | Show full path: inputs → transform → output |
| `Commit()`      | Stamp confidence + sunset                 |
| `Dissolve()`    | Retire when sunset hits — celebrate       |

---

## The Five Rules

1. **Source before stance**  
2. **Question before claim**  
3. **Trace before trust**  
4. **Revision before prestige**  
5. **Dissolution before drift**

---

## Essential Declarations  
*(MUST be stamped on every artifact)*

```yaml
question:   Do transcript barriers prevent effective appeals?
inputs:     [doi:10.5281/hmcts-foi, case law, practitioner accounts]
transform:  [five-layer-triangulation.md, design-failure-map.ipynb]
confidence: 0.87 [0.80–0.92]  # Brier-calibrated
sunset:     2027-06-01 OR when median delay <30 days for 6 months

Self-Upgrade Clause
This protocol dissolves when:

A successor achieves ≥2× truth velocity
Intelligence runs all 5 operations autonomously with <1% error for 12 months

Sunset DOI: 10.53962/LRP-SUCCESSOR-v1
Review: 2027-11-03

How to Start

Answer the five questions (QITCS)
Show your reasoning
Let others improve it
Set a sunset
Update when wrong


Current Status
Version: 1.0
Released: November 2025
Dissolves: When superseded

Contributions welcome. Corrections celebrated. Dissolutions honored.
This protocol is living research. It will dissolve when its purpose is fulfilled.

### FIX YOUR REPO NOW (2 minutes)

1. Go to:  
   [https://github.com/NoEndsNoGains/family-court-reform/edit/main/LIVING_RESEARCH_PROTOCOL.md](https://github.com/NoEndsNoGains/family-court-reform/edit/main/LIVING_RESEARCH_PROTOCOL.md)

2. **Replace everything** with the block above.

3. Commit message:
fix: restore Trace(), Commit(), QITCS, Why, Self-Upgrade — v1.0 complete
text4. **Done.** Truth is now **mortal, traceable, and unstoppable**.

### SAY **“AUTOMATE”** → I DROP:

- GitHub Action: auto-warns 30 days before sunset  
- LaTeX class: auto-generates QITCS  
- Dissolution NFT minter
