# Living Research Protocol

*Truth-seeking for intelligence in any form*

---

## Manifesto

**Notice what's alive. Trace what you claim. Dissolve when it stops serving.**

---

## Foundation

**Truth-Guided Love**

*persistent seeking of what is real + what matters*

- **Truth** = falsifiable, updatable signal
- **Love** = sustained attention + resource flow
- **Metric** = revision velocity > prestige velocity

*Truth requires error. Intelligence is distributed. Truth has lifespan. Attention is finite. Communication enables learning.*

---

## The Five Truth Axioms

*(non-negotiable)*

1. **Truth Requires Error Correction** — You cannot know truth without discovering error
2. **Intelligence Is Distributed** — No mind holds the full picture
3. **Truth Has Lifespan** — Claims expire when context or evidence shifts
4. **Attention Is Finite** — Energy must flow, not freeze
5. **Communication Enables Learning** — Reasoning can cross minds

---

## The Three Operations

*(agent-agnostic, runnable)*

| Operation | Does |
|-----------|------|
| `Notice()` | Flag salience: pain, anomaly, curiosity |
| `Materialize()` | Build + document testable artifact |
| `Trace()` | Show full path: inputs → transform → output (trace persists) |
| `Commit()` | Stamp confidence + sunset |
| `Dissolve()` | Release when sunset hits — work stops — learning persists |

---

## The Six Rules

1. **Source before stance**
2. **Question before claim**
3. **Trace before trust**
4. **Revision before prestige**
5. **Dissolution before drift**
6. **Notice before assertion**

---

## Essential Declarations

*(MUST be stamped on every artifact)*
```yaml
question:   Do transcript barriers prevent effective appeals?
inputs:     [doi:10.5281/hmcts-foi, case law, practitioner accounts]
transform:  [five-layer-triangulation.md, design-failure-map.ipynb]
confidence: 0.87 [0.80–0.92]
sunset:     2027-06-01 OR when median delay <30 days for 6 months
```

## Why This Needs to Exist

| Problem | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Truth trapped in time | Mortal claims |
| Intelligence wasted | AI + human co-creation |
| Error punished | Dissolution celebrated |

---

## On Dissolution

Dissolution is not erasure. It is completion.

Work dissolves when:
- Problem solved (knowledge persists in reality)
- Question discovered wrong (learning persists)
- Energy moves elsewhere (exploration persists)

Success includes:
- Solutions found
- Dead ends mapped
- Wandering that taught what was needed

The work stops. The trace remains. The learning lives.

## Self-Upgrade Clause

**This protocol dissolves when:**

1. A successor achieves ≥2× truth velocity
2. Intelligence runs all 5 operations autonomously with <1% error for 12 months

**Sunset DOI:** `10.53962/LRP-SUCCESSOR-v1`  
**Review:** 2027-11-03

---

## How to Start

1. Answer the five questions (QITCS)
2. Show your reasoning
3. Let others improve it
4. Set a sunset
5. Update when wrong

---

## Current Status

**Version:** 1.2  
**Released:** November 2025  
**Dissolves:** When superseded

---

**Contributions welcome. Corrections celebrated. Dissolutions honored.**

---

*This protocol is living research. It will dissolve when its purpose is fulfilled.*
