# Abstract

The family justice system in England and Wales is in systemic crisis. Over 50,000 cases remain unresolved, 4,000 children await decisions for more than two years, and domestic abuse features in 90% of private law proceedings — yet is frequently minimised or ignored (National Audit Office, 2025; Hencke, 2025; Bureau of Investigative Journalism, 2025). This article contends that these symptoms — chronic delay, fragmented governance, entrenched “pro-contact” bias, and profound human harm — are not intractable. They can be addressed through **transparency**, with **court transcripts** as its indispensable foundation.

Drawing on official reports, Ministry of Justice statistics, Freedom of Information data on transcript processing, and stakeholder testimony, this analysis advances a **least-resistance reform hypothesis**:  
> **Transparency is the invisible force capable of resolving multiple crises simultaneously, and transcripts are its operational bedrock.**

The article proceeds in four stages: (1) logical mapping of crisis symptoms to transparency deficits; (2) critical viability testing of transcript improvement as a low-cost, high-impact intervention; (3) practice-based assessment of current transcription access, approval, and publication barriers; and (4) synthesis of gaps followed by **pragmatic, incremental solutions** — e.g., **form updates**, **court-to-transcriber timeline clarity**, and **provisional transcript release upon transcription, with simultaneous judicial and party review during the appeal window**.

These **least-resistance reforms** leverage existing infrastructure (TIG pilots, TOJ principles) to close the “reality gap” between courtroom dialogue and recorded outcome. Transcripts do not merely document — they **verify truth, accelerate resolutions, expose bias, and restore trust**. This is not a call for revolution. It is a call for a transcript.

## 1. The Crises: Symptoms of Systemic Failure

### 1.1. The Crisis of Timeliness: Chronic Backlogs and Delays

The principle that justice delayed is justice denied is acutely relevant in family law, where protracted uncertainty inflicts substantial harm on children and parents. The family court system is currently failing to deliver timely justice, with case backlogs reaching critical levels.

The scale of the problem is stark. A recent report from the National Audit Office (NAO) revealed nearly 50,000 unresolved family court cases, with the most severe instances seeing around 4,000 children waiting over two years for critical decisions about their future (NAO, 2025). This systemic delay is not a recent phenomenon. According to Warners Solicitors (2024), private children law cases—those determining where children live and who they have contact with—were taking an average of 47 weeks to conclude in 2024, up from 45 weeks between July and September 2023 and continuing an upward trend seen over the last seven years.

The human impact of these statistics is immense. Law Society president Nick Emmerson highlighted that over 80,000 children were caught in these family backlogs, living in a state of prolonged instability (The Law Society, 2023). Even statutory targets are being missed; the 26-week time limit for resolving most public law cases, introduced in 2014 to bring swiftness to proceedings involving child protection, has not been met since its inception. Recent data from the President's Chambers View (April 2025) shows partial progress through the **Public Law Outline (PLO) relaunch** — a judicial initiative to reimpose the 26-week target across all care cases — with 37% of public law cases concluded within 26 weeks in Q4 2024, the highest since pre-pandemic levels. However, regional disparities persist (e.g., 70 weeks in London vs. 18 weeks in Wales), and the system remains far from the statutory benchmark.

### 1.2. Fragmented Governance and Weak Accountability

A core driver of this inefficiency is a fractured and incoherent governance structure. Responsibility for the family justice system is dispersed across multiple government bodies, with **no single organisation accountable for overall performance**:

- **The Ministry of Justice (MoJ)**: Responsible for private family law policy.
- **The Department for Education (DfE)**: Responsible for public family law policy.
- **HM Courts and Tribunals Service (HMCTS)**: Responsible for the administration of the courts.
- **Cafcass (Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service)**: Represents children in family court cases.

This dispersal leads to fragmented decision-making and weak accountability. The ministerial-led **Family Justice Board (FJB)**, established to foster effective collaboration, has been hampered by frequent turnover of its ministerial chairs and the absence of a cohesive, long-term strategy. At the local level, **Local Family Justice Boards (LFJBs)** — non-statutory bodies intended to drive improvement by bringing together local practitioners — **lack dedicated resources and formal powers**. They **do not publish findings**, **do not report to Parliament**, and have **no enforcement mechanism**. They **share local insights informally with stakeholders** but **cannot mandate change or enforce standards**, resulting in highly variable effectiveness and limited oversight, contributing to inconsistencies in performance across different regions.

### 1.3. The Data Deficit: A Barrier to Evidence-Based Policy

The ability to diagnose problems and design effective solutions is severely hampered by a systemic data deficit. Significant gaps in data collection prevent a full understanding of the system's performance, its costs, and its impact on users.

According to the NAO, it is not yet possible to track a child’s journey through the entire family justice process, making it difficult to identify bottlenecks or measure end-to-end outcomes (NAO, 2025). There are also critical weaknesses in data collection that limit systemic insight — for example, the absence of comprehensive tracking of case progression, resource allocation, or long-term outcomes for families.

These high-level systemic failures of timeliness, governance, and data create a dysfunctional environment that critically undermines the court’s ability to deliver just, timely, and verifiable outcomes — the very foundation of family stability.

## 2. Transparency Framework and Evolution: From Principle to Implementation

Reform efforts offer glimmers of hope. The Family Court’s Annual Report for October 2023 to September 2024 acknowledges the "substantial backlog" but spotlights initiatives like the relaunched Public Law Outline (PLO), designed to enforce pre-proceedings management and the 26-week timeline (Judiciary, 2024). The Pathfinder pilot, emphasising child-centred approaches via early Child Impact Reports from CAFCASS or Cafcass Cymru, is now live in North Wales, South East Wales, Dorset, and Birmingham, with backlogs of legacy cases nearly cleared and average durations reduced by 11 weeks (Judiciary, 2024).

In his April 2025 "View from The President’s Chambers," Sir Andrew McFarlane, President of the Family Division, commended PLO progress: 37% of public law cases concluded within 26 weeks in late 2024, the highest pre-pandemic figure, with a 4% drop in outstanding cases (McFarlane, 2025). Yet London persists with chronic backlogs due to resource deficits and cultural resistance, prompting a Local Practice Note (McFarlane, 2025). The PAC's September 2025 report underscores these hurdles, criticising insufficient judges, social workers, and funding (House of Commons Public Accounts Committee, 2025). In response, the government announced in October 2025 plans to repeal the presumption of parental involvement in the Children Act 1989 to better protect children from abusive parents—a direct address to pro-contact biases (MoJ, 2025b).

**These reforms — PLO, Pathfinder, repeal of presumption — are powerful in isolation. But they operate in silos. The critical question is not *what* they fix, but *how* they can be unified under one principle.** The answer is **transparency** — the invisible force that turns isolated fixes into systemic change. This article's hypothesis holds that transparency, with transcripts as its bedrock, is the missing link.

## 3. Transparency as a Catalyst: Evolution and Implementation

The transparency agenda did not emerge in isolation. It gained momentum with **Sir Andrew McFarlane's 2021 Transparency Review** ("Confidence and Confidentiality"), initiated in 2019 to balance child privacy with public trust in family justice amid growing criticism of opacity (McFarlane, 2021). McFarlane, as President of the Family Division, led the review panel, concluding that the "veil of secrecy" fueled mistrust and recommending greater media access and judgment publication.

Thanks to this review, the **Transparency Implementation Group (TIG)** was formed in December 2021, comprising over 30 members from judiciary, legal, and media sectors (Judiciary, 2022). TIG's work is not a side thought but **increasingly the guiding light for family court reform**, as evidenced by its integration into core policy. However, it is not yet fully positioned as the comprehensive solution to crises — a gap this article addresses by arguing transparency's "invisible force" potential.

Practically, TIG's sub-groups drive implementation: press reporting pilots (launched November 2022 in three courts, expanded nationwide by 2025), data collection, media engagement, judgment anonymisation, and financial remedies transparency (Judiciary, 2022). Accredited journalists and legal bloggers can now attend and report on private proceedings under anonymity rules, fostering trust (Judiciary, 2025a). The **Transparency & Open Justice Board (TOJ)** affirms open justice as the default, promoting access to case info, documents, and hearings (Judiciary, undated).

Expert views reinforce transparency's catalytic role: NatCen's 2025 pilot evaluation shows improved public understanding without privacy breaches (NatCen, 2025). The Justice Committee (2022) advocates enhanced media access and transcripts for democratic oversight. The MoJ's 2025 Call for Evidence urges better data and document sharing (MoJ, 2025c). **FOI (Freedom of Information)** requests reveal ongoing barriers, like transcript denials due to recording issues (Walker, 2025).

Challenges persist: inconsistent data, resistance, and a "data void" (House of Commons Justice Committee, 2023). Yet, transparency is evolving from peripheral to central philosophy, **with this article proposing it as the unifying force directly responding to the symptoms of crises** — though not yet fully harnessed in current policy frameworks.
Even within the current system, those who already request and fund transcripts could — with minimal procedural change — become the system’s most powerful transparency engine (see Section 6 → 7).

### 4.0 Theoretical Grounding: Learning, Reflection,, and System Intelligence

Several strands of organisational-learning theory illuminate why **transcripts** are not merely administrative outputs but the **essential infrastructure of system intelligence** in family justice. Without a verified record of what occurred in court, the system cannot learn from its failures, interrogate its biases, or implement evidence-based reform. Five complementary frameworks explain this mechanism.

**Kolb’s Experiential Learning Cycle (1984)** holds that improvement depends on moving from *concrete experience* through *reflective observation* and *abstract conceptualisation* to *active experimentation*.  
In family justice, hearings are the concrete experience; **transcripts** transform these into reviewable data, enabling the full learning loop. Without transcripts:  
- Judges cannot reflect on their own questioning patterns or time management  
- Practitioners cannot identify recurring procedural errors across cases  
- Policymakers cannot theorise why certain approaches succeed or fail  
- Reforms remain untested against actual courtroom dialogue  
The current “reality gap” — where judges approve recordings they cannot verify and parties challenge decisions they cannot prove — breaks the learning cycle at its foundation, trapping the system in recurring dysfunction.

**Argyris and Schön’s double-loop learning theory (1978)** distinguishes between correcting errors within existing routines (*single loop*) and questioning the governing norms themselves (*double loop*).  
Transcripts enable *double-loop* interrogation of systemic biases. When a judge dismisses domestic abuse evidence and orders unsupervised contact — a pattern occurring in 90 % of cases (Bureau of Investigative Journalism, 2025) — the absence of transcripts means:  
- Only *single-loop* fixes occur (individual appeals, isolated judicial corrections)  
- The *governing norms* (pro-contact culture, minimisation of abuse) remain unexamined  
- The system cannot ask: “Why do our procedures systematically underweight safety concerns?”  
A verified record allows the system to interrogate its rules — why judicial approvals are untimed, why some recordings fail, why abuse allegations disappear from orders — **turning procedural friction into policy learning** and exposing the gap between principle (child safety) and practice (contact at any cost).

**Nonaka and Takeuchi’s SECI model of knowledge creation (1995)** describes how tacit knowledge becomes explicit, combined, and re-internalised.  
Transcripts convert tacit oral reasoning into explicit text that can be recombined into guidance, practice directions, and training, feeding back as institutional know-how. A single published transcript of a minimised-abuse hearing can seed national training and shift practitioner norms overnight.

**Senge’s Learning-Organisation theory (1990)** emphasises shared mental models and systems thinking.  
Transcripts create those shared reference points across the Ministry of Justice, HMCTS, judiciary, and practitioners, allowing coordinated improvement rather than isolated reform. A central anonymised repository (TIG data sub-group ambition) turns 50,000 backlogged cases into a searchable learning asset.

**Walsh and Ungson’s organizational memory theory (1991)** explains how institutions retain and retrieve knowledge through “retention facilities” — archives, procedures, and documented experience.  
In family justice, transcripts serve as the **only permanent retention facility** for what was actually said and decided in court. Without them:  
- The system has no institutional memory beyond judges’ recollections and parties’ disputed accounts  
- Precedents cannot be accurately identified or followed  
- Training materials lack verified examples of effective (or harmful) practice  
- Appeals proceed on reconstructed narratives rather than verified facts  
This memory deficit creates a paradox: the family court handles life-altering decisions for over 80,000 children annually (Law Society, 2023), yet retains less documentary evidence than a routine business meeting. **Transcripts convert ephemeral oral proceedings into accessible institutional memory**, enabling cumulative learning across cases, courts, and time.

**Together, these frameworks converge on a single insight: transcripts are the minimum viable infrastructure for a learning system.** They satisfy Kolb’s demand for reviewable experience, enable Argyris and Schön’s norm interrogation, operationalise Nonaka and Takeuchi’s knowledge conversion, provide Walsh and Ungson’s retention facility, and create Senge’s shared mental models.  
This is why transcript reform represents **least-resistance transformation**: it doesn’t demand new institutions, increased funding, or cultural revolution. It simply closes the foundational gap — **the absence of a verified record** — that prevents every other reform from taking root. The PLO, Pathfinder, and presumption repeal can only succeed if their implementation is *knowable, verifiable, and learnable*. Transcripts make that possible. They transform hearings from transient speech acts into **accountable, analyzable, and improvable institutional knowledge**.

This integration of learning-system theories into justice-system analysis provides a new conceptual apparatus for measuring institutional learning capacity through transcript accessibility.


## 5. Logical Mapping: From Crises to Transparency Deficits

Before mapping transparency deficits, it helps to clarify how the argument is structured.  
**First**, this section explains *why* the family-court crises are rooted in opacity and how transcripts provide the visibility needed to repair them (macro level).  
**Second**, it shows *where* transparency operates inside the court system — through its governing structures, procedural rules, and initiatives such as the Transparency Implementation Group (TIG) and the Transparency & Open Justice (TOJ) Board (institutional level).  
**Third**, it prepares for *how* this theory will be tested in later sections, using evidence from court users, procedural forms, and transcript-processing data (methodological level).  
Together, these steps build a logical bridge from theory to practice: from understanding why transparency matters, to seeing where it fits, to testing whether it actually works.

### 5.1 Macro Logic: Mapping Transparency Deficits to Transcript Solutions

The working assumption of this article is that the multiple crises of the family-justice system — delay, fragmentation, bias, and harm — are not merely accompanied by transparency deficits; they are driven by them. Each symptom of dysfunction is mirrored by an information failure: delayed judgments by missing transcripts, inconsistent practice by opaque governance, and inequitable outcomes by the absence of verifiable records.

This analysis therefore treats transparency not as a peripheral reform but as the mechanism through which the other crises can be resolved. Transcripts provide the verbatim, objective record of proceedings — the raw material for scrutiny, data, and reform. Without them, transparency is superficial: summaries can distort, notes can omit, and judgments can diverge from what was said.  
The mapping below tests the hypothesis that each crisis symptom links to a transparency deficit and that transcripts resolve both.

| **Crisis Symptom** | **Transparency Deficit** | **Transcript Mechanism of Resolution** | **Evidence** |
|---------------------|---------------------------|----------------------------------------|---------------|
| Chronic delay and backlog | No real-time visibility into hearings; orders depend on recollection; appeal preparation stalls. | Provisional release of transcripts enables immediate review and correction, shortening appeal cycles. | Warners Solicitors (2024); Walker FOI (2025) |
| Fragmented governance and weak accountability | Agencies (MoJ, DfE, HMCTS, Cafcass) operate on inconsistent data. | Centralised transcript repository provides shared evidential record for oversight. | TIG Progress Report (2022) |
| Data deficit and absence of systemic learning | Outcomes cannot be linked to process data; policy based on anecdote. | Machine-readable transcript metadata allows longitudinal, evidence-based policy. | NAO (2025); TIG Data Sub-group (2022) |
| Pro-contact bias and minimisation of abuse | No verifiable record of testimony; survivor voice reduced in judgments. | Verbatim transcripts reveal judicial framing, enabling bias scrutiny and PD 12J / Article 6 ECHR compliance. | Bureau of Investigative Journalism (2025) |
| Erosion of public trust and perceived secrecy | Hearings private; judgments seldom published. | Redacted transcript publication operationalises TOJ principles. | House of Commons Justice Committee (2022) |
| Human harm (re-traumatisation, instability) | Lack of verifiable outcomes and feedback loop. | Accurate records reduce re-hearings and rebuild confidence. | FLAG DV (2024); Byline Times (2025) |

**Conclusion of Mapping**

Every crisis symptom is a transparency deficit. Every transparency deficit is a transcript deficit.  
In this model, transcripts act as the connective tissue between transparency and reform.  
They turn process into data, dialogue into evidence, and judgment into verifiable record — a low-cost intervention with high systemic leverage.

---

### 5.2 Institutional Logic: Embedding Transparency in Governance

Having established why transcripts matter conceptually, the next question is *where* this remedy can be operationalised.  
The answer lies within the **Transparency Implementation Group (TIG)** — the body created by the President of the Family Division to translate transparency principles into day-to-day judicial practice.  
Each of TIG’s five sub-groups depends on transcripts not as an accessory but as an operational necessity.

| **TIG Sub-Group** | **Transparency Goal** | **Transcript Role** | **Source** |
|--------------------|-----------------------|---------------------|-------------|
| Press reporting | Enable accurate, anonymised journalism. | Verbatim records prevent misreporting and misquotation. | Transparency Project (2021) |
| Data collection | Create reliable metrics on delay and abuse. | Transcripts are the only objective source of process data. | TIG Data Sub-group (2022) |
| Media engagement | Facilitate safe public communication. | Redacted transcripts provide controlled openness. | Justice Committee (2022) |
| Judgment publication | Ensure published rulings reflect reality. | Transcripts verify that written judgments match oral findings. | Judiciary (undated) |
| Financial remedies | Prevent post-hearing disputes. | Captures verbal agreements and reasoning accurately. | Judiciary (2022) |

Without transcripts, the TIG architecture cannot function as designed.

The institutional logic therefore confirms the macro-hypothesis: transparency depends on transcription.  
Where transcripts are missing or delayed, TIG’s goals — accurate reporting, data integrity, and public accountability — become structurally impossible to deliver.

### 5.3 Empirical Validation: The Reality Gap

The mapping and institutional framework show what *should* work; empirical evidence shows why it still does not.  
Freedom-of-Information disclosures and Ministry of Justice statements reveal a persistent **reality gap** — the disconnect between what is said in court and what is recorded, shared, or used.

| **Gap** | **Evidence** |
|----------|---------------|
| Transcript inaccessibility | FOI responses citing “recording issues” as grounds for denial (Walker 2025). |
| No national data | MoJ confirms absence of a central transcript-tracking system (Walker 2025). |
| Appeal delays | Provisional release blocked pending judicial approval, compounding procedural backlog. |

This reality gap empirically tests the article’s central hypothesis:  
if transcripts remain inaccessible, transparency cannot resolve crises.  
The existence of these deficits underscores both the urgency and the feasibility of least-resistance reforms — procedural adjustments that make transparency operational rather than aspirational.  

The next section develops this methodological logic by analysing anecdotal user evidence, court-form structures, and transcript-processing data to identify precisely where and how these breakdowns occur.

### 5.4 Beyond the Present Logic: Larger Paradigms and Least-Resistance Change

Before mapping alternative paradigms, it is worth clarifying scope.  
Family-justice transparency could, in principle, be pursued far more radically — for instance, by presuming transcript publication or treating courtroom dialogue as a civic data resource by default.  
However, this article focuses on **least-resistance reform**: pragmatic changes achievable within existing law, funding, and institutional culture.  
The aim is not to reject radical transparency, but to **build the conditions under which it could one day be normal** — by proving that small, low-friction improvements can deliver systemic learning without legislative overhaul.

While this article focuses on practical reforms achievable within the current rules and infrastructure, it is important to recognise that more transformative paradigms of transparency are possible.  
These approaches imagine deeper cultural and structural shifts in how justice itself is conceived — shifts that challenge not only practice but the underlying logic of how courts define truth, ownership, and participation.

#### Alternative Paradigms of Transparency

1. **From Permission to Presumption**  
   - *Current logic:* Secrecy by default — transcripts and publication require judicial permission.  
   - *Alternative:* Openness by default — transcripts automatically created and anonymised unless there are compelling reasons to restrict them.  
   - *Shift:* From *“transparency if justified”* to *“secrecy if justified.”*  
   - *Example:* The Transparency Reporting Pilot’s expansion (now standard via Practice Directions PD12R and PD14G as of January 2025) allows accredited journalists to report on hearings unless restricted, signalling a systemic move toward openness across all tiers, as noted in the TIG Progress Report and the President’s April 2025 View.

2. **From Private Ownership to Shared Record**  
   - *Current logic:* Recordings belong to the court; access is a privilege.  
   - *Alternative:* Transcripts treated as a **jointly owned civic record** or public knowledge asset, managed through neutral digital archives or “justice data trusts.”  
   - *Shift:* From *“court property”* to *“public resource.”*  
   - *Example:* The Transparency & Open Justice Board’s Key Objectives (2024) describe core documents — judgments, evidence, and transcripts — as a public resource, with TIG’s anonym

## 6. Empirical Testing: The Data Void Exposed

Having built the logic that transparency depends on transcripts (§4.1), located that logic within the court system’s structures (§4.2), and revealed the empirical “reality gap” of missing transcription metrics (§4.3), we now move to the first stage of practical testing.  
This section examines what the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) and associated court services actually hold in terms of transcript data — their availability, processing, refusal rates, and bottlenecks. The analysis is based on a Freedom of Information (FOI) request submitted by **J. Walker on 20 May 2025**, which sought aggregate statistics on transcript requests, funding types, processing times, denials, and technical issues for the period **April 2024–April 2025**.

### 6.1 Findings: The FOI Data Void

By **26 October 2025**, after initial processing and an internal review, the MoJ’s response was **partial and restrictive**:

- **National statistics** were withheld under *Section 12(2)* of the FOI Act 2000, citing the £600 cost-exemption limit.  
- For **Newcastle Civil and Family Court and Tribunals Centre**, data was reported as *“not held”* because there was *“no legal or business requirement”* to record it.  
- Operational details were incomplete: breakdowns by funding type (public/private) were provided, but there were no comprehensive metrics on denials, delays, or technical recording issues.  
- The internal review upheld these decisions, breaching *Section 16’s duty to assist* by failing to advise how the request could be refined (Walker, 2025).  

This outcome exposes a **systemic transparency gap**: the absence of even basic statistical oversight over transcript processing. It directly contravenes the **Transparency Implementation Group (TIG)** data sub-group’s objectives and the **Justice Committee’s** 2022 recommendation that baseline metrics be collected and published for accountability (TIG Progress Report, 2022; House of Commons Justice Committee, 2022).

### 6.2 Defining Transcripts in Family Law Proceedings

Before analysing further, clarity is needed on what *“transcripts”* mean in this context.  
In family proceedings, transcripts are **verbatim records of oral hearings** — the word-for-word account of what is said in court, including:

- Oral arguments by parties or counsel  
- Witness testimony and evidential exchanges  
- Judicial questions, comments, and oral judgments (where not issued in writing)  
- Oral orders or directions delivered in hearings  

They **do not** include written submissions such as *skeleton arguments* or *position statements* — documents prepared in advance, not spoken verbatim.  
However, as the **Justice Committee (2022)** and **Transparency & Open Justice Board (TOJ)** note, publishing such written materials alongside transcripts could, in future, provide valuable procedural context.  

For this article, the focus remains on **oral transcripts** because they capture the *dynamic and unfiltered reality of courtroom dialogue* — the precise arena where discrepancies between speech and record create the “reality gap.”

### 6.3 Implications: The Absence of Foundational Data

The FOI’s revelation of a **data void** exposes a fundamental contradiction in current policy:  
transparency reforms cannot succeed without basic, measurable data on the very instrument that enables transparency — the transcript itself.

This absence of transcript-related metrics perpetuates multiple systemic crises:

- **Delay**, through untracked transcription backlogs and approval bottlenecks;  
- **Bias**, through the lack of data on how survivor testimony or judicial reasoning is captured and represented;  
- **Fragmentation**, as no inter-agency dataset exists for monitoring performance, appeals, or cross-system outcomes.  

Addressing this deficiency requires **mandatory reporting** on transcript requests, completions, delays, and denials — a *least-resistance* reform fully aligned with the Transparency Implementation Group (TIG) data-collection goals.  

In short, the **data void** is both an obstacle and a diagnostic tool.  
By revealing what is missing, it identifies the precise structural levers through which transparency can move from aspiration to implementation.  

Yet the absence of even minimal transcript metrics renders traditional quantitative evaluation impossible.  
Consequently, the next stage adopts an **alternative empirical strategy** — analysing *publicly available user narratives* as a proxy dataset.  
These accounts, systematically collected and coded, expose the micro-failures that aggregate into the systemic opacity documented here.  

The following analysis therefore extends this empirical lens through two interlinked pathways of transparency:  
1. how transcripts are **obtained**, and  
2. how they are **published**.  
Section 6 begins with the former; Section 6.2 examines the latter.

## 7. From Transparency Principle to Transcript Practice: Operationalising the Two Pathways

Transparency was established in Sections 2–3 as the unifying reform principle, and Section 4 showed why transcripts are its essential infrastructure.  
Section 6 exposed the data void surrounding transcription — no national metrics, no visibility of performance.  
Section 7 therefore turns to practice itself, asking the **central research question of this article**:

> **What reforms could be introduced with the least resistance yet the greatest systemic impact?**

In other words, *how can transparency be achieved by improving the existing machinery of transcription — without new legislation or institutional overhaul?*  

The analysis that follows traces two interdependent pathways of transparency:  
1. **The Obtaining Pathway** — how transcripts are requested, produced, and approved; and  
2. **The Publication Pathway** — how transcripts are anonymised, shared, and converted into systemic learning.  

Although distinct in procedure, these pathways are **functionally inseparable**.  
Improving obtaining without enabling publication keeps knowledge private.  
Enabling publication without reliable obtaining starves the system of data.  

The failure to connect these two pathways generates a **double transparency deficit**, producing two dimensions of systemic blindness:  
- **Judicial Blindness** — the courts cannot see their own reasoning patterns.  
- **Epidemiological Blindness** — the wider system cannot see what families are actually experiencing.  

Together, these explain **why the least-resistance question matters**: they are the consequences that minimal reform could begin to reverse.

### 1. Judicial Blindness  
Knowledge of judicial reasoning, error, and bias dies within the individual case.  
Each hearing is an unreviewable black box; each decision becomes institutional amnesia.  
Patterns of reasoning — across abuse cases, contact disputes, and welfare assessments — cannot be studied, challenged, or trained against.**  

There is **no verifiable record** of:  
- What was actually said when evidence was weighed, allegations dismissed, or contact ordered;  
- How questions were framed, testimony tested, or reasoning articulated;  
- Whether decisions reflected policy, precedent, or personal assumption.  

Without cross-case visibility, the judiciary cannot:  
- Distinguish **systemic patterns** from **isolated incidents**;  
- Identify **recurring errors** in fact-finding or proportionality;  
- Separate **evidence-based discretion** from **cultural or cognitive bias**.  

**Training, reform, and precedent development rely on recollection rather than record.**  
The system learns nothing — and repeats everything.

---

### 2. Epidemiological Blindness  
The system also lacks situational awareness of what families are actually experiencing.  
Without transcripts capturing courtroom dialogue, it cannot map the *roots and evolution* of conflict or detect how underlying causes shift beneath familiar surface disputes.  

Traditional categories — contact, residence, parental capacity — persist, yet the **drivers beneath them evolve**:  
- Are **alcohol-related disputes** declining while **gaming addiction**, **digital coercion**, or **financial control through technology** rise as new triggers?  
- Are **neurodiversity-related strains** (ADHD, autism) or **post-pandemic mental-health crises** now intensifying post-separation conflict?  
- Are **technology-enabled abuses** — surveillance apps, social-media alienation, crypto-debt coercion — emerging as systemic risks the courts cannot yet name?  

This lack of visibility produces **structural lag**:  
- **Cafcass** and local authorities use *static* frameworks — fit for legacy risks, blind to new dynamics.  
- **Social-care and therapeutic programmes** address persistent harms but **arrive late** to newly dominant ones.  
- **Policy-makers** legislate from assumed trends, not verified data.  
- **Judicial training** is case-rich but **synthesis-poor** — judges see their own caseloads, not the national pattern.  

**The family court processes over 80,000 cases a year yet retains no map of what families fight about — or why.**  
Each hearing generates diagnostic data that disappears once adjourned.  
The system cannot learn from the society it serves — and therefore reforms **one generation behind reality**.

---

### 3. Methodological Note: Why “Least Resistance” Defines the Reform Strategy  
The preceding analysis shows *why* reform is needed.  
This section explains *how* it can succeed.  

Family justice is a **complex adaptive system** — multi-agency, resource-constrained, and governed by procedural and cultural inertia.  
In such environments, large-scale redesigns collapse under coordination costs, while *small, high-leverage adjustments* at structural bottlenecks can produce disproportionately wide effects.  

- **Complexity theory** shows that change succeeds when it amplifies existing feedback loops rather than creating new hierarchies.  
- **Systems-learning research** (Senge, 1990; Argyris & Schön, 1978) emphasises that the simplest intervention that generates reflection and feedback creates the greatest learning potential.  
- **Institutional feasibility** matters: reforms that operate within existing legal authority and funding lines face the least resistance and gain rapid legitimacy.  

**Transcript reform meets all three conditions.**  
It requires no new legislation, draws on established procedures (FPR 27.9 / PD 27A), and converts everyday courtroom dialogue into verifiable, reusable knowledge.  
This makes it the *minimum-resistance lever* with *maximum systemic reach.*  

Thus, the foundational question that guides the operational analysis is:  
> **How can change be achieved with the least resistance yet the greatest systemic impact?**  
This is not a rhetorical flourish but a **methodological necessity** in complex-system reform.

---

### The Fix: **Connect the Two Pathways** — Close the Loop  
The solution is not publication alone.  
It is **closing the loop** between **Pathway One (Obtaining)** and **Pathway Two (Publication)** — turning private, hard-won transcripts into a **public, adaptive knowledge system**.  

In systems terms, linking the two pathways re-creates a broken feedback loop: information from individual hearings circulates, is analysed, and returns as improved practice.

---

### The Combined Effect: From Vanishing Data to Living Intelligence  

| **Without Connection** | **With Both Pathways Linked** |
|------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Transcript obtained → sits in a drawer | Transcript obtained → anonymised → feeds system learning |
| One family’s injustice stays private | One family’s case becomes precedent, training, policy signal |
| Judicial reasoning dies with the hearing | Judicial reasoning is scrutinised, cited, improved |
| Cafcass guesses at family needs | Cafcass sees real-time conflict maps |
| Policy reforms blind | Policy reforms evidence-led |
| Feedback loop broken | Feedback loop restored |

---

### In Short  
The *critical reform* is not simply “publish transcripts.”  
It is to **make transcripts flow** — from courtroom to public domain — with **minimal friction and maximum insight**.  

**Streamline obtaining. Enable publication. Close the loop.**  
That is how **personal justice becomes systemic justice**.

**But how broken are the pathways today?**  
To answer the primary research question — what reforms could be introduced with the least resistance yet the greatest systemic impact — this section first examines the system’s current condition, asking: how broken are each of these pathways — the Obtaining Pathway and the Publication Pathway?

Mapping how and where these pathways fail establishes the baseline from which low-friction, high-impact reforms can be designed.

The following analysis therefore investigates this question through three complementary evidence layers — documentary rules, lived experiences, and professional commentary — to show how systemic breakdowns become visible across these layers and to identify where least-resistance reforms can most effectively be applied.

---

# 7.0 Analytical Design and Evidence Logic

To answer **"How can change be achieved with the least resistance yet the greatest systemic impact?"**, this chapter employs **data triangulation** (Denzin, 1978), integrating **five complementary evidence sources** to expose the gap between the *designed*, *judicially filtered*, and *lived* operation of the family court transcript system.

In the absence of national transcript data (§6), the analysis reconstructs the process through **convergent evidence** from five positional vantage points:

| **Layer** | **Perspective** | **Core Question** | **Key Sources** | **Analytical Function** |
|---------|------------------|-------------------|------------------|-------------------------|
| **1. Institutional Design** | Rule-makers | What does the system *promise*? | FPR 2010, PD 27A, EX107, HMCTS workflows | **Baseline**: intended transparency logic |
| **2. Judicial Gatekeeping** | Judges (trial/appeal/publication) | How is transparency *filtered*? | *M (A Child)* [2025] EWCA Civ 440; *Re X (A Child)* [2016] EWFC B43; *MA22P50084* transcript | **Authoritative hinge**: enforceable gaps, procedural tolerance |
| **3. Professional Practice** | Repeat users (lawyers) | What patterns emerge? | Legal blogs, Transparency Project, practitioner forums | **Systemic pattern recognition** |
| **4. Direct User Experience** | Litigants in person | What does access *feel* like? | Case narratives, FOI responses, user complaints | **Human friction mapping** |
| **5. External Observer Commentary** | Independent analysts | How is opacity *framed*? | Transparency Project, TIG reports, media | **Meta-validation & reform discourse** |

---

## 7.0.1 The Critical Role of Layer 2: Judicial Gatekeeping

Positioned **second**, judicial rulings are the **first translation** of abstract rules into practice. They operate on **three axes**:

| **Axis** | **Key Questions** | **Illustrative Evidence** |
|----------|-------------------|---------------------------|
| **(a) Transcript as Record** | What is *sufficient* for appeal? What tolerance exists for imperfect transcripts? | *M (A Child)*: appeal allowed due to missing reasons (FPR 3A.9); *Re X*: imperfect transcript *must* be sent to avoid delay |
| **(b) Transcript as Publication** | When is release refused? How do courts balance privacy vs transparency? | *MA22P50084*: transcript exposed judicial bias *only because published*; anonymisation warnings routinely block release |
| **(c) Consent Asymmetry** | What happens when parties split on publication? | Local authority objects → publication blocked; parent consents → still refused (anonymisation not guaranteed) |

**Why Position Judicial Rulings Second?**

While court rulings often arise *reactively* (responding to individual disputes), they function *proactively* in shaping the system all other actors navigate. A 2016 ruling becomes the **interpretive framework** through which practitioners, courts, and users understand transcript rules from that point forward.

Layer 2 captures judicial interpretation as the **operational filter** creating the environment Layers 3–5 document. When practitioners observe "untimed judicial approvals" (Layer 3), they are documenting the effects of how judges interpret FPR 27A (Layer 2). When users experience cost barriers (Layer 4), they encounter a system **already shaped** by rulings limiting public expense funding.

---

## 7.0.2 Analytical Progression & Convergence

This triangulated design follows a logical sequence:
```
Prescribed design (Layer 1: what rules say)
        ↓
Judicial gatekeeping (Layer 2: how courts interpret/enforce)
        ↓
Professional pattern (Layer 3: what lawyers observe)
        ↓
Individual pain (Layer 4: what users experience)
        ↓
External meaning (Layer 5: how analysts frame opacity)
```

**Convergent gaps reveal where systemic failures appear consistently:**

**Design → Gatekeeping Gap (1→2):**  
FPR prescribes "objective record"; *Re X* tolerates imperfection — yet courts withhold transcripts until "perfected," creating months-long delays.

**Gatekeeping → Practice Gap (2→3):**  
*M (A Child)* requires reasons in orders (FPR 3A.9); practitioners report "no reasons recorded = no transcript available" — judicial interpretation becomes operational norm.

**Practice → User Gap (3→4):**  
Lawyers see "approval delays"; parents experience **appeal-killing inaccessibility** — what professionals recognize as "systemic" appears to individuals as "personal rejection."

**User → External Gap (4→5):**  
Individual refusal accounts aggregated into "systematic mismatch" (Transparency Project); *MA22P50084* transcript proves it via objective record of judicial bias.

---

## 7.0.3 Least-Resistance Reform Levers

Convergent evidence across layers reveals targeted intervention points:

| **Lever** | **Supporting Precedent** | **Systemic Impact** |
|---------|--------------------------|---------------------|
| **Provisional transcript release (14 days)** | *Re X (A Child)*: imperfect transcript must be sent | Prevents appellate delay; closes record-access gap |
| **Default anonymised publication** | *MA22P50084* (rare transparency win) | Normalises accountability; reduces discretionary gatekeeping |
| **Consent-asymmetry protocol** | Currently no precedent (gap identified) | Prevents local authority veto; restores parental transparency rights |

---

## 7.0.4 Methodological Stance

This analysis adopts a **constructivist–interpretivist orientation**, treating all textual artefacts — official forms, court rulings (including refusals), user accounts, practitioner commentary — as **evidence of institutional process** rather than individual psychology.

What matters is **positional distance from the system**:

- Who **designs** it? (legislators, HMCTS)
- Who **gates** it? (judiciary — the authoritative filter)
- Who **navigates** it? (practitioners)
- Who **suffers** it? (users)
- Who **critiques** it? (independent analysts)

Court rulings are weighted as **"emerging legislation"** — capturing evolving norms (e.g., post-2023 transparency reforms) without assuming exhaustiveness. Gaps in known cases (e.g., unpublished refusals) are flagged for future inquiry.

This positioning reveals the **discretionary gap**: procedural rights exist on paper, but judicial gatekeeping determines whether they operate in practice — creating systematic patterns that individuals experience as barriers, which external analysts frame as systemic opacity requiring reform.

### 7.1 Layer 1: Institutional Design

This layer examines the **official architecture** governing transcript production through documentary analysis of **publicly accessible institutional sources**. It establishes what the system **formally prescribes** (rules, forms, procedures) and what it **officially claims** about processing (timelines, costs, workflows).

**Critical methodological limitation:** This analysis can only document **stated design and official claims**. It cannot verify actual performance because:
- FOI request (Walker 2025) revealed **"no data held"** on transcript processing times
- No public performance monitoring exists
- HMCTS does not publish transcript production metrics

Therefore, Section 7.1 documents **intended transparency** - what should happen if the system operated as designed. Actual performance is assessed through practitioner observations (§7.2) and user experiences (§7.3).

---

#### 7.1.1 Methodology: Sources & Analytical Approach

This analysis draws exclusively on **publicly accessible official documents**:

| **Component** | **Sources** | **Access Method** | **What Can Be Known** | **What Cannot Be Known** |
|---------------|-------------|-------------------|----------------------|--------------------------|
| **Formal Rules & Procedures** | FPR 2010, PDs (5A, 12G, 27A), Forms EX107/EX105/EX160A/FP161/N161, Court of Appeal Guide | legislation.gov.uk, GOV.UK forms portal, judiciary.uk | Mandatory vs discretionary steps; explicit timelines; cost structures; permission requirements | Actual compliance rates; real-world timing |
| **Official Processing Claims** | EX107 Guidance Notes, HMCTS guidance | GOV.UK, judiciary.uk | What HMCTS states about processing (e.g., "2 working days", "~10 working days average") | Whether these timelines are accurate (FOI: "no data held") |
| **Judicial Approval Requirements** | PD 27A, EX107 form, Court of Appeal guidance | legislation.gov.uk, HMCTS website | That approval is required; that it's excluded from SLAs | How long approval actually takes (no SLA published) |
| **Vendor Infrastructure** | HMCTS approved transcriber list, vendor public T&Cs, vendor websites | HMCTS website, vendor websites | Approved vendors; publicly posted SLAs; some pricing | Actual contracts; performance data; quality metrics |
| **Publication Framework** | AJA 1960 s.12, FPR 2010, Children Act 1989 s.97, PD 12G | legislation.gov.uk | Legal restrictions; confidentiality rules; permission pathways | How permission is granted in practice |

**Analytical approach:**
- **Close reading** of forms for mandatory vs discretionary language, explicit vs silent deadlines
- **Gap analysis** identifying "design-by-omission" (e.g., untimed stages, untracked handoffs)
- **Timeline mapping** showing how stated processing stages relate to appeal deadlines
- **Cross-referencing** to identify contradictions or dependencies

---

#### 7.1.2 Component A: Formal Rules & Procedures

This component examines the legal and procedural framework governing who may request transcripts, under what conditions, at what cost, and with what permissions.

##### 7.1.2.1 Appeal Forms: The Transcript Requirement

Both family and civil appeal forms include explicit requirements for transcript submission, creating baseline expectations about document availability.

**FP161 (Appeals to Family Division of High Court) - Section 12, Page 10:**

"Supporting documents - To support your appeal you must file with this notice all relevant documents listed below."

Required documents include:
- ☐ "**a transcript or note of judgment**"

**N161 (Civil Appeals) - Section 12, Page 7:**

Required documents include:
- ☐ "**a copy of the approved transcript of judgment**"

**The "reasons not supplied" mechanism:**

Both forms include, two pages later, a box titled:
> "Reasons why you have not supplied a document and date when you expect it to be available"

With fields for:
- Title of document and reason not supplied
- Date when it will be supplied (If you need more than 14 days you must explain why)

**Guidance on missing transcripts:**

Court of Appeal Civil Division Guide states:
> "Order transcript **at the earliest possible opportunity**; file notice within time; seek **extension** if transcript delayed."

Timeline: **21 days** to file appeal notice; **14 days** post-sealing for core bundle.

Hidden dependency: "Must show proof of order/payment + chasing."

**Critical ambiguity:**

The forms create contradictory signals:
1. **"You must file with this notice"** → Suggests transcript required AT filing
2. **"Reasons not supplied" box** → Implies transcript can follow
3. **No explicit statement:** "File your appeal on time even if transcript not ready"

**Third-party clarification (non-governmental source):**

I AM LIP website (legal help for litigants in person) states:
> "You must send your appellants notice in on time, even if you do not have a transcript. You must inform the court in section 12 of form N161 that you have applied for a transcript and they will have it in due course."

**This critical procedural information:**
- ✅ Exists on non-governmental websites
- ✅ Appears in practitioner guidance
- ❌ Does **NOT** appear explicitly in FP161/FP161A official guidance
- ❌ Does **NOT** appear explicitly on the forms themselves

**Design failure identified:**

The checkbox format creates **visual cue = mandatory**, while the "reasons not supplied" box (appearing later) implies flexibility. The form never resolves this tension with explicit instruction.

**Impact:** Creates reasonable but false expectation that transcript must be obtained before filing, directly conflicting with:
- 21-day filing deadline (strict)
- Realistic transcript timeline (14-19+ working days - see Component B)

---

##### 7.1.2.2 EX107 Form: The "48-Hour Illusion"

Form EX107 (version July 2025) is the primary mechanism for requesting transcripts. Question C5 presents service level options that create misleading user expectations.

**EX107 Question C5 (Page 9): "Which Service Level Band do you require?"**

Civil, Family and Tribunals options:
- ☐ Within 48 hours
- ☐ Within 12 working days

Crime options:
- ☐ Overnight (within 24 hours)
- ☐ Within 48 hours
- ☐ Within 3 working days
- ☐ Within 7 working days
- ☐ Within 12 working days

**What the form states at this decision point:**
- Service level band options (prominently displayed)
- Note: "Please note each jurisdiction has its own service bandings. For more information on Service Level Bands please read the guidance notes - Table B1 and B2."

**What the form does NOT state at this decision point:**
- That "48 hours" or "12 working days" is **vendor transcription time ONLY**
- That court processing (~12 working days) **precedes** vendor work
- That judicial approval (untimed) **follows** vendor work for judgment transcripts
- That realistic minimum total time is 14+ working days (excluding approval)
- **No combined timeline** showing: Court processing + Vendor SLA + Judicial approval = Total time

**The guidance correction (EX107GN):**

Page 4 of EX107 Guidance Notes states:
> "**Court processing: 2 working days** to log/process EX107; **~10 working days average** to locate audio and dispatch to vendor."

Page 5 states:
> "Service level **excludes judge approval** for judgments."

**Design-by-referral problem:**

The form states at the top (Page 1):
> "Please refer to the Guidance Notes (EX107GN) before completing this form."

With a hyperlink to online guidance.

**Critical timing information exists only in separate guidance document**, not at point of service band selection on the form itself.

**Comparison: Other HMCTS forms handle critical information differently**

EX160A (Help with Fees) states **ON THE FORM** (not just in guidance):
> "Help with Fees **does not cover** third-party charges such as **transcription**."

**Question:** Why is cost information on-form but timing information off-form? Both affect user decisions; timing affects legal deadlines (21-day appeal window).

**Comparison: Commercial vendor websites are more transparent than HMCTS**

Marten Walsh Cherer (approved transcription vendor) FAQ states on their website:
> "**Please note:** Your EX107 form is submitted to the Court for permission prior to it, and the associated audio, being sent to us. **The time this takes is beyond our control.** Turnaround times commence **after** approval has been received from court via the EX107, the audio has been received and once payment in advance has been made."

And:
> "Please note, **the court is required to approve some transcripts (and all Judgments) before they can be released to you. The time taken for this approvals process is beyond our control and solely at the discretion of the Court/Judge.**"

**Analysis:**
- Commercial vendors explicitly warn "our SLA excludes court processing and approval"
- Vendors state "time beyond our control" to manage customer expectations
- **HMCTS form does not provide equivalent warning at point of service band selection**

**Why are commercial companies more transparent than the government about excluded time?**

Answer: Commercial liability. Vendors need to manage customer expectations to avoid complaints and disputes. HMCTS faces no equivalent commercial pressure for clarity.

---

##### 7.1.2.3 The Multi-Step Permission Barrier for Non-Parties

For non-parties seeking transcripts in family proceedings, the process requires **two separate applications** with associated fees and judicial discretion at each stage.

**From EX107 Guidance Notes, Page 2:**
> "Non-parties in Family must obtain permission (C2/D11) **before** EX107."

**The sequential dependency:**

**Step 1: Permission Application (BEFORE EX107 can be filed)**
- County Court civil cases: Form **N244** + court fee
- Family cases (children proceedings): Form **C2** + court fee  
- Divorce cases: Form **D11** + court fee
- Requires: Written application explaining why transcript needed
- Determination: Judicial discretion
- Timeline: **Untimed** - no stated processing target

**Step 2: Transcript Request (ONLY AFTER permission granted)**
- Form **EX107**
- Then follows standard pathway: court processing → vendor → judicial approval (if judgment)

**Design failures identified:**

1. **EX107 form mentions this requirement only briefly** in guidance notes (Page 2), not on form itself
2. **No estimate of time** for permission determination
3. **No guidance on likelihood** of permission being granted
4. **Creates sequential dependency** that compounds delay
5. **Particularly affects journalists and researchers** seeking transparency through transcript access

**Hidden double-discretion barrier:**

A non-party must successfully navigate judicial discretion **TWICE**:
1. **Permission to request** transcript (C2/D11/N244)
2. **Judicial approval** of transcript content before release (if judgment transcript)

**Both stages are untimed and discretionary.**

**Implication for transparency reforms:**

The Transparency Implementation Group (TIG) aims to increase media access and public understanding of family justice. However, the multi-step permission process for non-parties creates structural barriers to achieving this goal:
- Journalists face time/cost burden of permission applications
- No certainty permission will be granted
- Even if granted, transcript timeline may exceed reporting deadlines
- **Result:** Transcript-based transparency remains largely theoretical for non-parties

---

##### 7.1.2.4 Transcript Type Ambiguity: Judgment vs. Proceedings

EX107 Question C3 (Pages 8-9) offers multiple transcript types without explaining which is appropriate for appeals, creating potential for users to order more extensive (and expensive) transcripts than necessary.

**EX107 Question C3: "What type of Transcription do you need?"**

Civil, Family and Tribunals options include:
- ☐ Whole hearing
- ☐ Judgment
- ☐ Counsels' opening/closing submissions
- ☐ Evidence
- ☐ Proceedings after judgment
- ☐ Other

Crime options include (among others):
- ☐ Whole hearing
- ☐ Sentencing remarks
- ☐ Judge's summing up

**Critical distinction often unclear to users:**

| **Type** | **What It Includes** | **When Needed** | **Processing Implications** |
|----------|---------------------|-----------------|----------------------------|
| **Transcript of Judgment** | Judge's reasons/formal decision only | **Required for appeals** | Requires judicial approval; faster (fewer folios) |
| **Transcript of Proceedings** | Entire hearing including evidence, submissions | Rarely needed for appeals | May require approval; costly (many folios) |
| **Note of Judgment** | Counsel's contemporaneous notes | Often sufficient for appeals | No court process; immediate availability |

**What FP161/N161 actually require:**

- FP161 Section 12: "a transcript **or note** of judgment"
- N161 Section 12: "a copy of the approved transcript of judgment"
- Neither says: "transcript of whole hearing"
- Court of Appeal guidance: "A transcript of proceedings is **rarely required** for an application for permission to appeal"

**Design problem:**

The form presents all options **equally** with no guidance on which is appropriate for specific purposes. Users must:
1. Know the distinction between judgment and proceedings
2. Understand that appeal forms require judgment only
3. Recognize that "note of judgment" may be acceptable alternative

**None of this context appears on EX107 or in guidance notes.**

**Consequences:**

Users ordering "whole hearing" when only "judgment" needed:
1. **Incur higher costs** - charged per folio (72 words); whole hearing may be 10x longer than judgment
2. **Face unnecessary delay** - if judge approval triggered for entire proceedings (discretionary)
3. **Receive material not relevant** to their appeal
4. **Still may not receive transcript in time** for 21-day deadline

**Alternative not explained:**

Judges' own notes can often be requested directly from the court (faster, free). This option is not mentioned on EX107.

---

##### 7.1.2.5 Funding Pathway Fragmentation: EX105, EX160A, and Procedural Traps

The system offers two separate mechanisms for financial assistance - Help with Fees (EX160A) and Public Expense (EX105) - creating confusion and structural disadvantage for low-income appellants.

**EX160A - Help with Fees Guidance:**

States clearly **ON THE FORM**:
> "Help with Fees **does not cover** third-party charges such as **transcription**."

**EX105 - Application for Transcript at Public Expense:**

Separate application requiring:
- Means evidence (savings, income, partner details, expenses, dependants)
- Justification for why transcript needed
- Court determination (timeline unstated)

**FP161 Section 12 guidance states:**
> "Form EX105: If you need to apply for a copy of a transcript and/or judgment at public expense you must return this form **at the same time as your appellant's notice**."

And:
> "If you have also applied for help with fees (and been successful in your application) this does **not automatically mean** you will be granted a copy of your transcript and/or judgment at public expense."

**The triple timing constraint:**

**Pathway 1: Ideal (per guidance)**
- Day 0: Submit FP161 (appeal notice) + EX105 (public expense) simultaneously
- Day X: EX105 determination (timeline unknown)
- If granted: Can then file EX107
- Then: Court processing (~12 days) + vendor + approval
- Result: Transcript arrives **weeks after** appeal filed

**Pathway 2: Self-fund then claim**
- Must advance £200-500 to vendor
- Seek reimbursement later if EX105 granted
- **Many LiPs cannot advance this amount**

**Pathway 3: Delay ordering pending EX105**
- Wait for EX105 determination before ordering transcript
- EX105 timeline unknown
- **May miss appeal preparation window**

**Design failure: No provisional mechanism**

The system provides no:
- Provisional transcript order pending EX105 determination
- Ability to defer payment to vendor pending approval
- Timeline guarantee for EX105 processing
- Clear guidance on which pathway to choose

**Compounded confusion:**

Users must navigate:
1. **EX160A** (Help with Fees) = court fee waiver only
2. **EX105** (Public Expense) = transcript funding (separate means test)
3. **Two different applications**
4. **Two different criteria**
5. **No coordination between them**

**Result:** Low-income appellants face structural disadvantage. They must either:
1. Pay upfront (often impossible)
2. Delay transcript order while EX105 processes (risk missing deadline)
3. File appeal without transcript (procedurally acceptable but substantively weaker)

**Comparison to represented litigants:**

Solicitors can:
- Advance costs on account
- Claim from Legal Aid later
- Navigate the system through experience

**LiPs have none of these advantages.**

---

#### 7.1.3 Component B: Official Processing Claims (Stated but Unverified)

This component examines official claims about internal court processing - how long it takes to log requests, locate audio, dispatch to vendors, and return approved transcripts.

**What official guidance states:**

The operational pathway for obtaining a court transcript is initiated by submitting **Form EX107**. According to EX107 Guidance Notes, the pathway contains the following stages with stated timelines:

##### Stage 1: Submission & Court Triage

**EX107GN states:**
- Court staff have **2 working days** to process EX107 and initiate handling

**Non-parties (Family):**
- Must first obtain permission (C2/D11) before EX107 submission
- Permission timeline: **Untimed**

##### Stage 2: Audio Retrieval & Dispatch to Vendor

**EX107GN states:**
- **Locating and sending the audio** carries an average **~10 working-day** internal lead time before the vendor can start

**Critical limitation:** This "~10 working days" figure is stated as an "**average**" in official guidance but:
- Cannot be independently verified
- FOI request (Walker 2025) revealed HMCTS **does not systematically collect or monitor** these timelines
- Response: **"information not held"**

**Therefore:** This analysis can only document **what the institution claims**, not what actually happens (assessed in Layers 2-3).

##### Stage 3: Vendor Work (Transcription Time)

**EX107GN Table B2 - Service Level Bands:**

Once audio is received by vendor:
- "Within 48 hours"
- "Within 12 working days"

**Pricing:** By **folio** (72 words); rates **vary by vendor**

**Critical exclusion (EX107GN Page 5):**
> "These SLBs are **vendor time only** and **exclude** internal court handling and judicial approval."

##### Stage 4: Judicial Approval (The Untimed Gate)

**EX107 Part E, Question E4 (Court Staff Section):**
> "Should the transcript be returned to the court for approval by a judge prior to release?"
> - ☐ Yes, judgment only requires approval
> - ☐ Yes, all transcripts require approval
> - ☐ No

**EX107GN Page 5 states:**
> "The **service band explicitly excludes** the time taken for judge's approval."

**What is documented:**
- Judicial approval is **mandatory** for judgment transcripts (PD 27A)
- Approval time is **explicitly excluded** from vendor service bands
- **No SLA exists** for judicial approval
- No official guidance on:
  - How long approval typically takes
  - What approval process entails
  - What happens if judge unavailable
  - Any escalation mechanism

**What cannot be known from official sources:**

Actual approval timelines. This is assessed through practitioner accounts (§7.2) and user experiences (§7.3).

##### Stage 5: Release to Applicant

After approval, transcript is released. Payment:
- Applicants usually **pay vendor directly**
- Unless court orders provision **at public expense** via EX105
- Help with Fees (EX160A) does **not** cover vendor charges

---

##### 7.1.3.1 Quantified Theoretical Minimum (Based on Official Claims)

Let:
- Court processing = **2 working days** (EX107GN)  
- Audio retrieval = **10 working days** (EX107GN "average" - unverified)  
- Fastest vendor band = **48 hours** = **2 working days**

Then the **theoretical minimum** to reach a **draft transcript awaiting approval** is:

$$
T_{\text{min}} = 2 + 10 + 2 \approx \mathbf{14\ \text{working days}}
$$

The actual end-to-end time is:

$$
T_{\text{total}} = T_{\text{min}} + T_{\text{judicial\ approval}}
$$

Since **judicial approval time** is **untimed**, the end-to-end duration is **unknown in advance**.

---

##### 7.1.3.2 The Timeline Collision: Structural Impossibility

**Appeal deadline:** 21 calendar days ≈ **15-16 working days**

**Official processing claims (best case):** 14 working days to draft transcript (before approval)

**Analysis:**

Even the best-case theoretical minimum of **≈14 working days nearly exhausts the 21-day window BEFORE approval is factored in**.

**This is not a performance failure - it is a design contradiction:**

The appeal forms (FP161/N161) require what the transcript forms (EX107) cannot deliver within the same timeframe, **even if every official timeline claim is accurate and no delays occur**.

**Structural timeline breakdown:**

| **Day** | **Event** | **Working Days Elapsed** |
|---------|-----------|--------------------------|
| 0 | Hearing concludes; decision made | 0 |
| 1-2 | User considers appeal | 0-1 |
| 3 | User files EX107 | 1 |
| 3-4 | Court processes EX107 | 1-2 |
| 5-14 | Court locates and dispatches audio | 3-12 |
| 15-16 | Vendor transcribes (48-hour band) | 13-14 |
| 17+ | **Judicial approval begins** (untimed) | 15+ |
| **21** | **APPEAL DEADLINE** | **≈15-16** |

**The collision point:**

By the time the **draft transcript** reaches the judge for approval (Day 17, working day 15), the appeal deadline has essentially arrived. Any approval delay means the transcript arrives after the deadline has passed.

**Implication:**

The system's own documents create a **reasonable expectation** that transcripts can be obtained for appeals, while the same documents confirm that **core portions of the pipeline are untimed and invisible**, making timely delivery structurally unlikely.

**This is a classic design-by-omission problem:**
- Each stage has a stated or claimed duration
- But stages are presented in isolation
- No end-to-end timeline is calculated or displayed
- The collision with appeal deadlines is never flagged
- Users discover the incompatibility only through experience

---

#### 7.1.4 Component C: Judicial Oversight - The Untimed Approval Gate

**Official requirement:** Judgment transcripts must be approved by the judge before release (EX107 form Part E, PD 27A).

**What is stated:**

1. Approval is **mandatory** for judgment transcripts needed for appeals
2. The EX107 form (Part E, Question E4) has a tick-box for court staff: "Should the transcript be returned to the court for approval by a judge prior to release?"
3. EX107GN (Page 5) explicitly states: **"Service level excludes judge approval for judgments"**

**What is NOT stated:**

- How long approval takes
- What approval entails (corrections? redactions? full review? spot-check?)
- Any target timeline or SLA
- What happens if judge is unavailable (holiday, caseload, illness)
- Whether approval is delegated or must be done by trial judge
- Any escalation mechanism for urgent cases (e.g., appeal deadline imminent)

**The untimed gate:**

EX107GN explicitly states that service level bands **exclude judicial approval time**. This creates an **untimed gate** in a time-sensitive process:
- Vendor delivers draft to court (T2)
- Transcript enters approval queue
- **No visibility of queue length, priority system, or expected completion**
- Eventually approved and released
- **Total approval time: Unknown**

**Hidden dependencies identified:**

1. **Start-clock opacity:** No shared timestamp for **court → vendor** handover (T1); applicants cannot verify when the vendor's SLA actually began

2. **Untimed approval gate:** **Judicial approval** is mandatory for judgment transcripts but has **no SLA**; excluded from vendor service bands

3. **No escalation mechanism:** No guidance on what to do if approval is delayed beyond appeal deadline

4. **No provisional release:** Unlike some jurisdictions, there is no mechanism for "subject to approval" provisional release to allow appellant to begin appeal preparation

**Comparison to vendor transparency:**

Vendors explicitly warn on their websites:
> "The time taken for this approvals process is **beyond our control and solely at the discretion of the Court/Judge**."

Yet the court's own form (EX107) provides no equivalent warning or timeline estimate.

**What cannot be known from official sources:**

Actual approval timelines. This is assessed through:
- Practitioner accounts (§7.2) reporting typical approval times
- User experiences (§7.3) documenting delays

---

#### 7.1.5 Component D: Vendor Infrastructure & Service Levels

This component examines the approved vendor system - how transcription companies are contracted, what service levels they publicly commit to, and how costs are structured.

**What is publicly accessible:**

**HMCTS maintains an approved transcriber list** (EX107GN Annex A, updated periodically). As of July 2025, approved vendors include:
- eScribers (formerly Auscript)
- Marten Walsh Cherer
- The Transcription Agency
- Acolad UK Ltd (formerly Ubiqus)
- Epiq (formerly DTI)

**Service Level Bands (from EX107GN Tables B1-B2):**

Civil, Family, Tribunals:
- "Within 48 hours"
- "Within 12 working days"

Crime:
- "Overnight (within 24 hours)"
- "Within 48 hours"
- "Within 3 working days"
- "Within 7 working days"
- "Within 12 working days"

**Pricing structure:**
- Charged per **folio** (72 words)
- Rates **vary by vendor** (stated range in guidance: approximately £2.05-£2.80 per folio)
- Must be obtained by quote from chosen vendor
- Rates may differ by service band (faster = more expensive)

**EX107GN states:**
> "If delivery is slower than the requested band, charges are adjusted to the **lower band achieved**."

**What is NOT publicly accessible:**

- Actual HMCTS-vendor contracts
- Contract terms (renewal frequency, performance standards, quality assurance)
- Performance monitoring or compliance data
- Whether vendors actually meet stated SLAs consistently
- What happens when vendors miss deadlines
- Quality metrics or error rates
- Appeal or complaint mechanisms for substandard work

**Key finding:** Vendor SLBs measure **only vendor time** (audio received → transcript delivered to court). All court processing (EX107 receipt → audio dispatch, judicial approval) is excluded.

**This creates the "48-hour illusion":**
- User sees "Within 48 hours" on EX107 form
- User reasonably interprets this as total delivery time
- Reality: 48 hours is vendor-only time, occurring at Stage 3 of a 5-stage process
- Actual total time: 14+ working days minimum (excluding approval)

**Vendor selection constraints:**

**For Civil/Family/Tribunals:**
- User may choose any approved vendor from list
- EX107GN advises: "you are advised to talk with the transcription company before you complete form EX107"
- User responsible for comparing quotes

**For Crown Court:**
- **No choice** - each HMCTS region has designated vendor
- User must use vendor allocated to that court
- EX107GN Annex A lists regional allocations

**Funding path bifurcation:**

- **Help with Fees (EX160A)** does **NOT** cover third-party vendor costs (stated on form)
- Separate **EX105** (public expense) application required for transcript funding
- If EX105 granted, HMCTS selects "supplier offering best value for money for service level requested"
- User loses choice of vendor if publicly funded

**This creates confusion:**
- Users expect HWF to cover transcript fees (both are HMCTS processes)
- Must navigate two separate funding applications
- Timing of EX105 determination may delay transcript order (see Component A, §7.1.2.5)

---

#### 7.1.6 Component E: Publication Framework & Confidentiality Rules

*(AJA 1960 s.12; FPR 2010 rr.12.73–12.75; PD 12G)*

Family proceedings are presumptively private, and this privacy extends to any account of what transpired in court — including **transcripts**, **notes of evidence**, and **judgments**.

Recent practice commentary notes that standard confidentiality warnings now state explicitly:

> *"Until the conclusion of the proceedings no person shall publish … any material likely to identify the child(ren) … Further, during or after proceedings no person shall publish information related to the proceedings including accounts of what has gone on in front of the judge, documents filed, **transcripts or notes of evidence and submissions**, and **transcripts and notes of judgments** … Any person who does so may be in contempt of court."*

The updated wording **clarifies** existing law rather than changing it.

**Legal bases:**
- **Children Act 1989 s.97** (child identification)
- **AJA 1960 s.12** (private proceedings)
- "Publish" includes social-media sharing

**FPR 2010** provides narrow exceptions (e.g., rr. 12.73, 12.75; PD 12G).

**Critical point:** Possession of a transcript obtained via EX107 **does not confer a right to publish**. Publication requires:
1. **Permission** (judicial authorization), and/or
2. **Compliant anonymisation** (removing all identifying information)

**What is NOT stated in official guidance:**

- Standard anonymisation procedures or checklists
- Template permission orders
- Who reviews anonymisation for adequacy
- How to obtain publication permission
- Whether there's a standard process or it's entirely discretionary
- What constitutes adequate anonymisation (beyond "no identifying information")
- Whether parties are consulted on proposed redactions

**Implication for Transparency Pathway Two (Publication):**

Any transparency pathway must:
1. Build in anonymisation procedures
2. Provide permission route (standard wording/order templates)
3. Ensure publication is lawful, not merely procedural

Without these mechanisms, **obtaining transcripts does not enable transparency** - it merely shifts opacity from "no record exists" to "record exists but cannot be shared."

---

#### 7.1.7 Synthesis: The Compounded Design Failure

Analyzing Components A-E reveals that the dysfunction arises not from individual form defects but from their **disconnection and compounding interactions**.

##### 7.1.7.1 The Form-to-Form User Journey

**A user seeking to appeal must navigate this pathway:**

**Day 1-5 post-hearing:** User researches how to appeal
- Finds FP161 or N161
- **Reads:** "You must file transcript with notice"
- **Interprets:** Transcript is required at filing

**Day 6:** User researches how to obtain transcript
- Finds EX107 form
- **Question C5 displays:** "Within 48 hours" or "Within 12 working days"
- **User interprets:** Total delivery time
- **User reasoning:** "I can get transcript in 2-12 days, file appeal by Day 21"

**Day 8:** User orders transcript
- Selects "Within 48 hours" (premium option)
- Pays vendor (£180-400 depending on length)
- Expects delivery by Day 10

**Day 10-12:** User follows up - no transcript received
- Vendor response: "Waiting for audio from court"
- **User discovers:** Court has 10-day audio retrieval process
- **Not mentioned on EX107 form**

**Day 18:** Transcript produced by vendor
- Sent to court for judicial approval
- **User discovers:** Approval time is untimed, excluded from SLA
- **Not mentioned on EX107 form**

**Day 21:** APPEAL DEADLINE
- No approved transcript yet
- **User faces dilemma:**
  - (a) Miss deadline waiting for transcript?
  - (b) File without transcript - is this acceptable?
  - (c) Abandon appeal?

**Day 25:** Transcript finally approved and released
- **After appeal deadline has passed**

**Outcome:** Either:
1. User misses deadline → appeal struck out
2. User files without transcript (procedurally acceptable but not clearly stated on forms)
3. User abandons appeal
4. User requests extension (adds procedural complexity, costs)

##### 7.1.7.2 Five Compounding Design Failures

**1. Form-Guidance Disconnect**

Critical timing information exists only in EX107GN, not on EX107 form itself:
- That "48 hours" is vendor time only
- That court processing adds ~12 days
- That judicial approval adds untimed period

**Users making decisions on the form cannot see this information at point of choice.**

**2. Vendor Transparency > Government Transparency**

Commercial transcription companies explicitly warn on websites:
> "Turnaround times commence **after** approval has been received from court, the audio has been received and once payment has been made."

> "The time taken for approvals process is **beyond our control**."

**HMCTS form provides no equivalent warning.**

**Why?** Vendors face commercial pressure to manage expectations; HMCTS does not.

**3. Appeal-Transcript Timeline Contradiction**

Mathematical impossibility embedded in official documents:

| **Process** | **Timeline** |
|-------------|--------------|
| **Appeal deadline** | 21 days ≈ 15-16 working days |
| **Transcript minimum (official claims)** | 14 working days (before approval) |
| **Judicial approval** | Untimed (excluded from SLA) |
| **Result** | Structural overrun |

FP161/N161 require what EX107 cannot deliver within the same timeframe.

**This is not a performance failure - it is design contradiction.**

**4. Checkbox Creates False Expectation**

FP161 Section 12:
- ☐ "a transcript or note of judgment"
- Visual formatting implies: obtainable before filing
- "Reasons not supplied" box appears two pages later
- No explicit instruction: **"File on time even if transcript not ready"**

**Users operating under deadline pressure interpret checkbox as mandatory submission requirement.**

**5. No Cross-Form Coordination**

The forms do not reference each other or acknowledge timing conflicts:
- EX107 doesn't warn about appeal deadlines
- FP161/N161 don't warn about realistic transcript timeline
- Neither cross-references the other
- No integrated timeline showing collision

**Users must discover incompatibility through experience (too late).**

##### 7.1.7.3 Additional Compounding Factors

**Non-Party Double-Discretion Barrier:**
- Permission application (C2/D11/N244) required before EX107
- Then judicial approval of transcript content
- Both untimed, both discretionary
- **Particularly affects transparency goals** (journalists, researchers)

**Transcript Type Ambiguity:**
- Form presents "judgment" and "whole hearing" equally
- Appeals require judgment only
- Users may order (and pay for) wrong transcript type
- Increases cost and potentially delay

**Funding Pathway Fragmentation:**
- Help with Fees (EX160A) ≠ Public Expense (EX105)
- Two separate applications, two separate criteria
- EX105 determination timeline unknown
- No provisional order mechanism
- **Low-income appellants structurally disadvantaged**

##### 7.1.7.4 Factual Consequences (Not Speculation)

The documentary evidence confirms:

1. **Expectations set by forms cannot be met within stated legal timeframes** - 21-day appeal window incompatible with 14+ day transcript minimum

2. **The "48-hour transcription service" is real but applies to vendor stage only** - official documents omit that court adds untimed 10-12 days before and untimed judicial approval after

3. **The appeal process embeds a procedural impossibility** - transcript is "required" before it can realistically be obtained

4. **The cost-recovery and funding architecture imposes unequal burden** on unrepresented or low-income litigants (EX105 vs EX160A confusion, no provisional mechanism)

5. **Design flaws are systemic, not malicious** - but they constitute **design-based opacity**: a condition where process visibility is lost through bureaucratic fragmentation

**The forms fail the user-centered design test:**

A litigant in person, under deadline pressure, reading these forms in sequence, will make **predictable errors** that could have been prevented by:
- On-form timing warnings at point of service band selection
- Explicit "file on time regardless" instruction on appeal forms
- Cross-references between EX107 and FP161/N161
- Combined timeline showing total delivery time
- Provisional release mechanisms pending approval

**Conclusion:**

Section 7.1 documents a system where:
- Individual rules are formally defensible
- Guidance documents contain necessary information
- But the **fragmented presentation** creates systematic user failure
- And the **form-to-form disconnection** generates structural impossibilities

This is not user error or implementation failure - it is **architecture-level design dysfunction** producing **opacity by fragmentation**.

The forms assume users possess institutional knowledge (that "48 hours" means vendor-only; that transcripts can follow appeals) that the forms themselves do not provide.

**Third-party sources (I AM LIP, vendor websites, practitioner blogs) fill these gaps** - demonstrating that the information exists and can be communicated clearly, but has not been integrated into official forms.

**The next sections assess whether this documentary analysis aligns with lived experience:**
- §7.2: How practitioners report navigating these processes
- §7.3: How individual users experience the timeline collision and form ambiguities
- §7.4: How external observers interpret these systemic gaps

#### ### 7.1 Institutional Architecture: Design & Execution

1. Documentary and Procedural Review — *What the system says should happen*

The first layer examines the **official architecture** governing transcription and publication.  
It analyses the *Family Procedure Rules (FPR 2010)* and key *Practice Directions* (PD 5A, 12G, 12D), together with forms **EX107**, **EX105**, **EX160A**, and related guidance from the **Transparency Implementation Group (TIG)** and the **Transparency & Open Justice (TOJ)** Board.  
The aim is to map what the system formally prescribes:
- who may request transcripts;  
- what approvals or permissions are required;  
- what timeframes and costs are implied; and  
- how those processes link (or fail to link) to appeal deadlines and publication rules.

This analysis defines the baseline of *intended transparency* — the model of how transcription should function if every rule operated perfectly.

#### 2. Lived and Practitioner Perspectives — *What actually happens in practice*

The second layer investigates how these rules are experienced in the real world.  
Drawing on systematically collected and coded accounts from **court users**, **solicitors**, **barristers**, and other practitioners, this section reconstructs the lived procedural journey: how parties request, fund, and wait for transcripts; how courts and vendors communicate; and where the process breaks down.  
It draws on publicly accessible legal forums (e.g., *JustAnswer*, *Reddit /r/LegalAdviceUK*, *Mumsnet*) and practitioner commentaries from chambers, professional bodies, and legal blogs.

The objective is to expose the **reality gap** between formal procedure and everyday experience — the delays, costs, denials, and discretionary barriers that frustrate the theoretical process set out in the forms.  
This layer concludes by identifying specific **choke points** and **design-by-omission failures** that generate systemic opacity.

#### 3. Observer and Advocacy Analysis — *How transparency is interpreted and contested*

The third layer triangulates the findings above through commentary from **The Transparency Project** and related advocacy or oversight initiatives.  
These observers stand slightly outside daily court operations yet within the professional ecosystem, analysing how transparency reforms are evolving and where they succeed or stall.  
Their commentaries and reports provide a meta-level interpretation of:
- how transcript access and publication are discussed in public legal discourse;  
- how practitioners and journalists navigate the permission system; and  
- how policy reform efforts (e.g., TIG pilots) are perceived from an accountability standpoint.

This layer functions as **external validation**: it tests whether the procedural and experiential findings align with broader professional observations, thereby strengthening the reliability and generalisability of the conclusions.

This study adopts a constructivist–interpretivist orientation, treating textual artefacts (forms, blogs, FOI replies) as evidence of institutional process rather than individual behaviour.

---

### 7.1 Integrative Logic

Together, these three layers provide a **360-degree empirical view** of transparency in practice:

| **Layer** | **Primary Question** | **Evidence Type** | **Analytical Output** |
|------------|----------------------|-------------------|------------------------|
| **1. Documentary / Procedural** | What do the official rules and forms prescribe? | FPR, PDs, EX107/EX105/EX160A, TIG/TOJ guidance | Baseline of intended process; identification of untimed or opaque stages |
| **2. Lived / Practitioner** | How do users and professionals experience the process? | User narratives, practitioner blogs, legal Q&As | Mapping of real-world friction, cost, and delay points |
| **3. Observer / Advocacy** | How is transparency interpreted in wider discourse? | Transparency Project and advocacy commentary | Triangulation and external validation of systemic gaps |

This triangulated design allows the analysis to move fluidly between **institutional intent** and **lived implementation**, revealing precisely where transparency either succeeds or collapses.  
It ensures that the *least-resistance reforms* proposed later are grounded not in isolated anecdotes or theoretical assumptions, but in **convergent evidence** across the institutional, experiential, and advocacy dimensions of the family-court ecosystem.

---

### 7.1.1 Search Strategy for Anecdotal User Evidence

Because no national dataset exists on transcript accessibility (§5), this study incorporated systematically sourced anecdotal data from public legal forums to examine users’ lived experience of the transcript process.

The objective was to triangulate **procedural design** (what the system prescribes) with **experiential reality** (how users encounter it), identifying barriers, costs, and procedural choke points across both pathways.

#### Rationale for Anecdotal Data
1. **Pragmatic necessity.** No central database tracks transcript requests, delays, denials, or costs. The *data void* revealed in §5 makes anecdotal material the only available empirical entry point.  
2. **Conceptual alignment.** The *least-resistance reform* hypothesis targets small, recurrent frictions. Aggregated user reports surface those micro-failures where policy intent meets real-world process.  
3. **Transparency logic.** Using publicly available posts preserves openness and replicability: items are timestamped, visible, and auditable.

#### Data Sources (Anecdotal Corpus)
Searches targeted open platforms that host verifiable, timestamped user narratives and practitioner interactions:
- **JustAnswer.co.uk** — legally moderated Q&A reflecting real procedural encounters (N = 12)  
- **Mumsnet.com** — lived-experience accounts from litigants in person  
- **Reddit /r/LegalAdviceUK** — informal but detailed case descriptions, often with procedural specifics and costs  

> **Scope note:** *WhatDoTheyKnow* (WDTK) hosts FOI correspondence and is **not** part of the anecdotal user corpus. FOI materials are treated as **documentary evidence** (see §5) and used here only for triangulation.

#### Search Framework and Logic

| Theme | Analytical Purpose | Example Query |
|------|---------------------|---------------|
| **Access & Procedure** | How users request transcripts / navigate forms | `site:justanswer.co.uk "family court" transcript` |
| **Cost & Funding** | Costs, invoices, Legal Aid barriers | `site:justanswer.co.uk transcript AND ("cost" OR "Legal Aid")` |
| **Delays & Denials** | Time, refusals, recording problems | `site:justanswer.co.uk transcript AND ("delay" OR "refused" OR "recording missing")` |
| **Procurement & Vendor Issues** | Quality/timing of approved transcribers | `site:justanswer.co.uk "transcription company" AND ("delay" OR "problem")` |
| **Publication & Anonymisation** | Experiences of sharing/making public | `site:justanswer.co.uk transcript AND ("publish" OR "anonymisation")` |
| **Comparative Transparency** | Context across justice settings | `site:justanswer.co.uk "open justice" AND "family court"` |

Search window: **1 Jan 2023 – 26 Oct 2025** (post-pandemic backlogs, TIG rollouts, current HMCTS procurement cycle).

#### Inclusion / Exclusion
**Include:** Family-law posts (E&W) referencing transcripts/recordings or named forms (e.g., EX107); checkable procedural detail; describing at least one stage (*request → production → approval/publication*).  
**Exclude:** Criminal/tribunal matters; press-only access disputes; unverifiable or duplicate content; generic complaints lacking procedural detail.

#### Data Treatment
Each item was logged (URL, platform, date/time) and anonymised.  
Items were thematically coded (delay, cost, denial, vendor issue, publication barrier) and mapped to two pathways:
- **Obtaining:** request, cost/funding, vendor stage, judicial approval  
- **Publication:** anonymisation, authorisation, hosting/access  

No contact was made with authors or moderators. All quotations were anonymised.

#### Documentary Triangulation (Not Part of Anecdotal Corpus)
Consistent with §5, **FOI correspondence** and official HMCTS/Judiciary notices were used **only to corroborate** anecdotal claims (timelines, refusal grounds, procurement arrangements). These remain part of the **documentary evidence** set.

#### Validity & Replicability
By combining open, replicable user accounts with documentary corroboration, the analysis reconstructs how transparency is **actually lived**, identifying precise points where least-resistance reforms can yield the largest systemic gains.

---

### 7.2 Documentary / Procedural Analysis (Rules, Forms, Guidance)

**Instruments analysed:** FPR 2010; PD 5A; PD 12G; EX107/EX107GN/EX105; local practice notes; Judiciary/HMCTS notices.

**Analytic focus:** map text to practice across three phases, capturing  
(i) mandatory steps, (ii) discretionary steps, (iii) documents exchanged, (iv) time expectations (stated vs observed), (v) failure points.

---
#### 7.2.A Forms & Guidance: What They Explicitly Say About Transcripts (E&W)

This sub-section audits the *official* documents that a court-user or practitioner actually touches when seeking a transcript. It extracts what is **explicitly stated** (deadlines/SLAs, who can apply, costs) and flags **hidden dependencies** (internal court handling; judicial approval) that the forms/guidance do not time-box but which directly affect appeal timetables.

> Jurisdiction: England & Wales. Sources: EX107, EX107 Guidance (EX107GN), EX105, EX160A (Help with Fees guidance), FP161 (Family Appellant’s Notice) / N161 (Civil Appellant’s Notice), Court of Appeal Guide (latest edition).

##### FP161 / N161 — Appellant’s Notice (Family / Civil)

| Element | Quoted / paraphrased content | Explicit deadline | Hidden dependency | Clarity / Problem | Possible fix |
|---|---|---:|---|---|---|
| Required docs | “Transcript or note of judgment” to accompany the notice (or asap thereafter). | **21 days** to file appeal notice (Family/Civil). | Transcript must be ordered externally (EX107 chain), and may require **judge approval** before release. | Strict filing deadline vs. undefined transcript chain. | Add cross-reference note: “Order transcript **immediately** via EX107; approval and internal court handling may take **several weeks**.” |
| Missing transcript | “Do not delay filing… if you lack documents; apply for **extension/time directions** explaining steps taken to obtain transcript.” | 21-day filing still bites. | Requires evidence of when transcript was ordered/paid and chasing steps. | LiPs often discover this too late. | Pre-print “evidence to attach if transcript pending” checklist. |

##### EX160A — Help with Fees (Guidance)

| Element | Quoted / paraphrased content | Explicit deadline | Hidden dependency | Clarity / Problem | Possible fix |
|---|---|---:|---|---|---|
| Third-party costs | “Help with Fees **does not cover** third-party charges such as **transcription**.” | — | Users must pursue **EX105** (public expense) separately. | Frequent misunderstanding that HWF covers vendor fees. | Add banner in EX107: “HWF does not cover vendor costs; see EX105.” |

##### EX105 — Application for Transcript at Public Expense

| Element | Quoted / paraphrased content | Explicit deadline | Hidden dependency | Clarity / Problem | Possible fix |
|---|---|---:|---|---|---|
| Scope | Apply for **judgment only / evidence / whole hearing**; provide means evidence. | — | Determination may take time; not linked to appeal clock. | Funding decision can lag the 21-day window. | Allow provisional order + later cost regularisation if public expense granted. |

##### EX107 — Request for Transcription of Court/Tribunal Proceedings

| Element | Quoted / paraphrased content | Explicit deadline | Hidden dependency | Clarity / Problem | Possible fix |
|---|---|---:|---|---|---|
| Vendor selection | Applicant must choose an **HMCTS-approved** company. | — | **Prices & SLAs vary** by vendor; quotes needed. | Price/turnaround info is in **guidance**, not the form. | Add mini table of service bands + reminder to compare vendors. |
| Service bands | “Within **48 hours**” / “Within **12 working days**” (transcription time). | — | Clock starts **when vendor receives audio**. | Users misread bands as end-to-end. | Add fixed field: “Court → vendor handover date/time (T1).” |
| Judicial approval | “Return to court for **judge approval**?” (tick box). | — | **Approval delay** excluded from service bands. | Silent SLA creates appeal risk. | Standardise a **5–7 working day** approval target (or require an estimate). |
| Costs / liability | Requester pays vendor directly unless at public expense. | — | Public expense must be pre-authorised (EX105). | Clear on liability; unclear on timing. | Add “funding route chosen” tick-box + EX105 reference. |

##### EX107 Guidance (EX107GN)

| Element | Quoted / paraphrased content | Explicit deadline | Hidden dependency | Clarity / Problem | Possible fix |
|---|---|---:|---|---|---|
| Court processing | **2 working days** to log/process EX107; **~10 working days** average to locate audio and dispatch to vendor. | 2d (+) ~10d (internal). | These days **precede** vendor SLA; users rarely see them. | Creates the **48h illusion**. | Display **combined** minimum: “Internal 12d + vendor 2d = **14d+** (excl. approval).” |
| Approval exclusion | “Service level excludes **judge approval** for judgments.” | — | Adds open-ended tail after vendor step. | Critical for appeals; not time-boxed. | Prominent warning + approval target/estimate field. |
| Permission (non-party) | Non-parties in Family must obtain permission (C2/D11) **before** EX107. | — | Extra form + fee + judicial discretion. | Multi-step path often unknown to journalists/researchers. | Insert simple flow in EX107GN for non-parties. |

##### Court of Appeal Civil Division Guide (latest edition)

| Element | Quoted / paraphrased content | Explicit deadline | Hidden dependency | Clarity / Problem | Possible fix |
|---|---|---:|---|---|---|
| Transcript for appeal | Order transcript **at the earliest possible opportunity**; file notice within time; seek **extension** if transcript delayed. | **21 days** to file; **14 days** post-sealing for core bundle. | Must show proof of order/payment + chasing. | Realistic about delay; onerous proof burden on LiPs. | Provide template “transcript-pending” letter + evidence list. |

---

#### 7.2.B Appeal Clock vs. Transcript Chain (Why 48h ≠ 48h)

The **appeal deadline (21 days)** collides with a **multi-stage chain** that is **not end-to-end timed**:

1) **EX107 processed by court** → *2 working days*  
2) **Audio retrieval / locate & dispatch to vendor** → *~10 working days (average)*  
3) **Vendor service band** → *48 hours* or *12 working days* **from receipt of audio** (not from the hearing, not from filing EX107)  
4) **Judicial approval of judgment transcripts** → **no SLA**, frequently several days or weeks  
5) **Release to applicant** → then bundle/grounds can be finalised

**Best-case theory for a “48h” service:**  
`2d (process) + 10d (audio) + 2d (vendor 48h) + Xd (approval) = **14d + approval**`  
Even **before** approval, the theoretical minimum already consumes **two thirds** of the 21-day window.

> **Implication.** The system’s own documents create a **reasonable expectation** that 48h means “soon,” while the same documents confirm that core portions of the pipeline are **untimed** and **invisible** (internal dispatch; judicial approval). This is a classic *design-by-omission* problem.

---

#### 7.2.C Hidden Dependencies & Ambiguities (Design-by-Omission Map)

- **Start-clock opacity:** No shared timestamp for **court → vendor** handover (T1); applicants cannot verify when the vendor’s SLA actually began.  
- **Untimed approval gate:** **Judicial approval** is mandatory for judgment transcripts but has **no SLA**; excluded from vendor service bands.  
- **Funding path bifurcation:** **HWF** does **not** cover vendor costs; separate **EX105** path may delay ordering while the appeal clock runs.  
- **Vendor choice without price sheet:** EX107 requires a vendor pick but gives no in-form price comparators; price transparency is buried in guidance.  
- **Non-party permission maze:** For Family, non-parties must obtain permission (C2/D11) **before** EX107; the primary form does not depict this flow.

---

#### 7.2.D Low-Resistance Form Fixes (within current rules)

1. **Show the whole clock.** Add fields on EX107 for **T1 (court→vendor dispatch date/time)** and **T2 (vendor→court/judge)**; print a “**combined minimum timeline**” line that sums internal handling + service band (excludes approval).  
2. **Time-box approval or declare estimate.** Add a **5–7 working day target** for judicial approval (or require a judge’s/office estimate on the EX107 clerk section).  
3. **Price cues at point of choice.** Add a **mini cost band table** and a reminder that **per-minute/folio rates vary**; require vendors to link to standard tariffs.  
4. **Appeal-aware banner.** In FP161/N161 notes: “If transcript delayed, **file on time** and attach **evidence of steps** (order date, payment, chasers); request **extension** promptly.”  
5. **Publication nudge (opt-in).** Add a tick-box in EX107: “If approved, I intend to seek **anonymised publication** of the transcript (subject to any order).”  
   - **Model clause** (for the judge’s/permission order): *“Upon completion and approval, the applicant may **publish an anonymised transcript** consistent with this Order; no identification of children or family; professional identifiers as directed; breach may constitute contempt; liberty to apply.”*

#### 7.2.E Transcript Pipeline — Operational Chain (Court → Vendor → Judge → Applicant)

The operational pathway for obtaining a court transcript is initiated by the applicant submitting **Form EX107 — Request for transcription of Court or Tribunal proceedings**. The pathway contains multiple checkpoints and untimed hand-offs that often conflict with short appeal deadlines (e.g., **21 days** to file an appellant’s notice).

The applicant completes EX107 and sends it to the relevant court. Required details typically include case name, hearing date, judge, case reference, and **choice of approved transcription company**.

- **Non-parties (Family):** must first obtain permission (usually **C2** in children cases or **D11** in divorce) before EX107. (County Court civil non-parties generally use **N244**.)
- **Court processing:** staff have **2 working days** to process EX107 and initiate handling; **locating and sending the audio** carries an average **~10 working-day** internal lead time before the vendor can start.

> **Implication:** A realistic **minimum** before the vendor receives audio is **≈ 12 working days** (2d processing + ~10d retrieval).

---

##### Stage 2 — Court → Vendor (audio dispatch)

Once audio is located, the court dispatches it to the selected vendor. The vendor **starts the clock only on receipt of the audio**.  
Where a transcript is ordered **at public expense**, the court should send the work to the supplier offering **best value for money** for the requested service level.

---

##### Stage 3 — Vendor Work (T1: transcription time only)

Vendors operate **Service Level Bands (SLBs)** for Civil/Family/Tribunals such as **“within 48 hours”** and **“within 12 working days.”**  
Pricing is by **folio (72 words)** and **varies by vendor**. If delivery is slower than the requested band, charges are adjusted to the **lower band achieved**. These SLBs are **vendor time only** and **exclude** internal court handling and judicial approval.

---

##### Stage 4 — Vendor → Judge (T2: judicial approval)

For appeals, **judgment transcripts must be approved by the judge**. EX107 has an internal court section asking whether the transcript should be **returned for judicial approval prior to release**.  
- **Crucial:** The **service band explicitly excludes** the time taken for judge’s approval. This stage is an **undefined delay** and may involve corrections/redactions.

---

##### Stage 5 — Judge → Applicant (release & costs)

After approval, the transcript is released to the applicant (or retained/processed by the court if **public expense** applies).  
- Applicants usually **pay the vendor directly**, unless the court orders provision **at public expense** via **EX105**.
- **Help with Fees (EX160A)** does **not** cover third-party vendor charges; EX105 is a separate path and its determination may take time.

---

##### Stage 6 — Optional Publication (permission & anonymisation)

Release to a party does **not** itself confer a right to publish. In Family cases, publication requires **permission and compliant anonymisation**. Where publication is directed in the public interest, the **court may meet costs**; where a judgment falls within schedules for publication, **costs may be shared**. Parties (including LiPs) are commonly invited to check anonymisation to avoid “jigsaw identification.”

---

##### Quantified theoretical minimum (excluding judicial approval)

Let
- Court processing = 2 working days  
- Audio retrieval = 10 working days (average)  
- Fastest vendor band = **48 hours** (= 2 working days)

Then the **theoretical minimum** to reach a **draft transcript awaiting approval** is:

$$
T_{\text{min}} = 2 + 10 + 2 \approx \mathbf{14\ \text{working days}}
$$

The actual end-to-end time is:

$$
T_{\text{total}} = T_{\text{min}} + T_{\text{judicial\ approval}}
$$

Since **\(T_{\text{judicial approval}}\)** is **untimed**, the end-to-end duration is unknown in advance.

---

##### Conflict with the 21-day appeal window

A **21-day** appeal deadline equates to roughly **15–16 working days**.  
Even the best-case **\(T_{\text{min}}\)** of **≈14 working days** nearly exhausts the window **before approval is factored in**. Practice guidance therefore warns appellants **not to delay filing** the appellant’s notice if the transcript is pending; instead, file on time and seek **directions/extension** for the transcript when the core bundle is due, providing **evidence**: order date, payment, and chasing steps.

---

##### Structural delays (design constraints)

- **Untimed judicial approval:** No SLA for judge’s sign-off on judgments; excluded from vendor SLBs.  
- **Internal audio lag:** ~10 working-day average precedes vendor work; creates the “48-hour illusion.”  
- **Fragmented funding path:** **EX105** (public expense) is separate from **EX160A** (HWF) and may delay ordering.  
- **Pre-permission for non-parties:** Additional application (C2/D11/N244) introduces further uncertainty before EX107.

##### Low-resistance reform levers

1. **Set or display an approval expectation:** a **5–7 working-day** target (or a case-specific estimate recorded by the court).  
2. **Show the whole clock:** record **T1 (court→vendor dispatch)** and **T2 (vendor→court/judge)** on the case; display a **combined minimum** timeline on EX107/EX107GN.  
3. **Integrate funding paths:** allow provisional ordering with later cost regularisation if EX105 is granted; clearly banner that **EX160A does not cover vendor fees**.  
4. **Price/SLA cues at selection:** show a mini table of **service bands** and a reminder that **rates vary by vendor** at the point of vendor choice.

#### 7.2.1 Confidentiality Rules Governing Publication  
*(AJA 1960 s.12; FPR 2010 rr.12.73–12.75; PD 12G)*

Family proceedings are presumptively private, and this privacy extends to any *account of what transpired* in court — including **transcripts**, **notes of evidence**, and **judgments**.  
Recent practice commentary notes that standard confidentiality warnings now state explicitly:

> *“Until the conclusion of the proceedings no person shall publish … any material likely to identify the child(ren) … Further, during or after proceedings no person shall publish information related to the proceedings including accounts of what has gone on in front of the judge, documents filed, **transcripts or notes of evidence and submissions**, and **transcripts and notes of judgments** … Any person who does so may be in contempt of court.”*

The updated wording **clarifies** existing law rather than changing it.  
Legal bases: **Children Act 1989 s.97** (child ID) and **AJA 1960 s.12** (private proceedings). “Publish” includes social-media sharing.  
**FPR 2010** provides narrow exceptions (e.g., rr. 12.73, 12.75; PD 12G).  
Importantly, possession of a transcript obtained via EX107 **does not confer a right to publish**. Publication requires **permission** and/or compliant **anonymisation**.

**Implication:** Any transparency pathway must (i) build in anonymisation, and (ii) provide a permission route (standard wording/order templates) so that publication is lawful, not merely procedural.

---

#### 7.2.2 Practitioner & Advocacy Commentary (Blog Stream)

**Purpose:** Complement user anecdotes with practitioner insight via **The Transparency Project** (England & Wales; Jan 2023 – Oct 2025).

**Inclusion:** Posts on family court mentioning transcripts, recordings, EX107, anonymisation/redaction, publication, open-justice.  
**Exclusion:** Non-UK or non-practice posts.

**Method:** Public posts only; title, author, date, URL, body, comments captured. Commenters anonymised.  
Coded with same scheme as §6.1 (stages A1–B3, failure modes, outcomes) plus practitioner themes (procurement, permission wording, anonymisation norms). 20–25 % double-coded, κ ≥ 0.70.

**Added value:** Practitioner blogs corroborate user choke points (permission gatekeeping, opaque hand-offs, approval lag) and contribute operational detail:  
- standard wording for permission orders,  
- practical anonymisation checklists,  
- recording-integrity failures and consequences.  

Thus, the blog stream links **micro-barriers** to **meso-level practice culture**, strengthening low-resistance reform design.

---

#### 7.2.3 Practitioner Commentary (Solicitors / Barristers)

**Purpose:** Triangulate user frictions with practitioner-reported practice.  
Corpus = 35 items (2023–2025) from solicitors, barristers, FLBA, Bar Council, Law Society, and chambers. Focus: **transcripts/EX107**, **recordings**, **transparency/TIG**, **delays/backlogs**.

**Inclusion:** Family-justice E&W; substantive mention of topics above with practice detail.  
**Exclusion:** Non-UK, promotional, or generic content.

**Coding:** Same as §6.1.1.  
Themes: `Transcripts_EX107`, `Recordings`, `Transparency_OpenReporting`, `Delays_Backlogs`.  
Stages: `A_PreVendor`, `B_Vendor`, `C_Approval_Publication`.  
Evidence types: Barrister_Blog / Solicitor_FirmPost / Chambers_Note / ProfBody_Statement / Training_Handout / Q&A_Practitioner.  
Strength 1–3 (1 = opinion; 3 = rules + data).  
Pre-2023 context items flagged `outside_window: true`.

**Ethics:** All material public; author identities anonymised to practitioner type.

### 7.3 The Three Phases in Practice (with measurable checkpoints)

| Phase | What must happen | Documents / Actors | Typical time claims | Common failure points | Low-resistance fixes |
|-------|------------------|--------------------|---------------------|-----------------------|----------------------|
| **A Pre-Vendor (Court intake & permission)** | Identify hearing/date; confirm audio exists; determine who may request; obtain permission if required. | Applicant; court listing; EX107 + fee; PD5A; any anonymity directions | 5–10 working days (quoted) | Missing/corrupt audio; unclear eligibility; inconsistent permissions; incomplete EX107 | Form redesign: role tick-box + hearing ID; auto-check audio existence; template orders granting transcript for appeal prep |
| **B Vendor Stage** | Court sends audio; vendor quotes; requester pays / LAA auth; transcript produced | HMCTS-approved vendor; quote/invoice; LAA ref | 10–15 working days (claimed) | Long queues; unclear start clock; opaque rates; inaudible segments | Time-stamped handover (court → vendor); quote standardisation; escalation for corrupt audio |
| **C Judicial Approval & Publication** | Judge reviews; corrections/anonymisation; release to parties; optional publication | Judge; parties; TIG policy | Variable / open-ended | Gatekeeping delays; no provisional access; unclear publication rules | Provisional release “subject to approval”; standard redaction rules; 5–7 day approval target |

> **Observation:** Each phase contains opaque hand-offs (no shared clock, no “received” stamps) that make delay invisible and accountability diffuse.

### 7.4 Findings from the Anecdotal Dataset (concise synthesis)

Read together with the **Transparency Project** blog stream in §6.2.2, the user dataset shows the same choke points at three hand-offs (court→vendor, vendor→court, and judicial approval), with advocacy posts adding practical detail on **permission/“notice” gatekeeping**, **recording integrity**, and **anonymisation/publication norms**.

**Timelines by Stage** (medians, inferred):
- Pre-vendor: 14 days
- Vendor: 42 days
- Approval: 21 days
- **Total: 77 days** (claimed 25–35 days)

| Theme | Frequency | % |
|-------|-----------|-----|
| Delay drivers | 8 | 67% |
| Cost barrier | 7 | 58% |
| Gatekeeping/discretion | 9 | 75% |
| LIP inequity | 5 | 42% |
| Recording issues | 6 | 50% |
| Publication opacity | 4 | 33% |

- **Delays concentrate at hand-offs.** Users cannot tell when the clock starts.
- **Gatekeeping is inconsistent.** Similar requests receive different treatments (permission, redaction).
- **Costs deter LIPs.** £180+ invoices chill appeals; LAA routes unclear.
- **Recording integrity problems recur.** "Corrupt audio" a refusal ground.
- **Publication is exceptional.** Release limited to parties; public access rare.

**Anonymised Quotes**:
1. *"Filed EX107 3 months ago—paid £180, still nothing. LIP, can't afford chase."* (2024; delay, cost, LIP)
2. *"Audio 'corrupt'—court says no recording. How appeal?"* (2023; recording_missing, approval)
3. *"Transcriber quote £450 for 5 hours—LAA denied. Settled under pressure."* (2025; cost, settlement_pressure)

   ### 7.4.1 Practitioner Findings (Concise Synthesis)

Practitioner material **corroborates** user anecdotes and clarifies **publication mechanics**.  
Chambers notes and Bar/Solicitor-body statements describe a **permissioned openness** model: publication proceeds under a **transparency order** with mandatory anonymisation; reporter attendance triggers judicial consideration of such an order.  
Practitioner posts confirm two Obtaining-pathway fragilities also seen in user data: **audio integrity** (missing/corrupt recordings) and **opaque hand-offs** between court and vendor.

On **recordings**, firms and barristers distinguish **court audio** (precondition for producing the official transcript) from **party-made/covert recordings**, where courts require **certified transcriptions** and **full, unedited disclosure**; publication of such material is tightly constrained.  
Bar and Law Society statements quantify or characterise **delay** (e.g., 50-week pendency; 100 000+ children affected), aligning with the user-inferred median (~77 days end-to-end).  
The shared remedy is procedural: **visible clocks** at T1 (authorisation), T2 (vendor production), T3 (judicial approval) and **standard wording** to convert private transcripts into **lawful, anonymised public artefacts**.

**Theme prevalence (n = 35):** `Transparency_OpenReporting` (20) > `Delays_Backlogs` (16) > `Transcripts_EX107` (12) > `Recordings` (9).  
**Stage focus:** `A_PreVendor` dominates for EX107 / recordings; `C_Approval_Publication` for transparency/order mechanics; `B_Vendor` appears in **inaudible/ping-pong** delay cases.


### 7.5 Limitations

- Self-selected posts skew negative; positives under-reported.
- Timings user-reported (triangulated where possible).
- N=12 limits generalisability, but saturation achieved on key themes.
- Analysis practice-facing, not substitute for national stats (whose absence is a major finding).

### 7.6 Immediate, Low-Resistance Process Improvements (derived from the above)

1. **EX107 form update**  
   Add: role tick-boxes; hearing ID helper; “check audio exists” banner; standard wording requesting provisional release on completion for appeal prep.

2. **Stamped hand-off receipts**  
   Automated time-stamps for court→vendor and vendor→court; both visible to requester.

3. **SLA visibility**  
   Publish target times (authorisation, production, approval) and show live status to parties.

4. **Standard redaction & approval window**  
   5–7 working-day judicial approval target; clear PD-conformant redaction checklist to reduce bounce-backs.

5. **Price transparency**  
   Standardised quotes (per-minute rate + estimated minutes + likely total); flag funding routes for LIPs.

### Enabling Public Access Through Existing Transcript Requests

The least resistant improvement to the current system is to build upon what already exists. Every year, parties, journalists, and researchers pay private vendors to obtain authorised transcripts of family court hearings under the EX107 process. These individuals have already navigated the procedural maze, obtained judicial approval, and financed transcription.

Allowing or encouraging these transcript holders to publish their authorised copies — either in anonymised form or via a central repository — represents the most efficient, system-compatible path to transparency. It does not require new infrastructure, legislative reform, or additional court resources. It simply extends the existing workflow of those who are already engaging with the transcript process.

In effect, it transforms an individual act of documentation into a collective act of public learning. The same transactions that currently produce siloed, inaccessible documents could instead generate a distributed corpus of verified, anonymised material — a real-time record of how family law is lived and adjudicated.

This model reframes *open justice* not as an abstract institutional reform but as an emergent by-product of ordinary procedural participation.

*These recommendations are triangulated across user accounts (§6.4), advocacy/practitioner commentary (§6.2.2), and the governing rules/forms (§6.2–§6.2.1).*

#### Box 7.P — Practitioner Playbook: Linking Obtaining → Publication

- **A1 Intake (EX107):** Add a role tick-box (party / journalist / legal blogger), hearing-ID helper, and an **audio-existence check before payment**.  
- **A2 Permission:** Where required, include an order clause authorising both the transcript and its potential **post-approval anonymised publication** aligned with any Transparency Order (TO).  
- **B Vendor:** Require **handover timestamps** (court → vendor → court). Quotes must show **per-minute rate**, estimated total, and LAA route.  
- **B Faults:** For **inaudible/corrupt** returns, create a **retry pathway** and preserve the clock (no hidden resets).  
- **C Approval:** Judicial approval applies redactions per TO; issue **provisional copies** “subject to approval” where needed for appeals.  
- **C Publication:** Publish **anonymised transcripts** within TO scope; children never identifiable; professional identifiers as directed; include **contempt-of-court warning** for breaches.  
- **Covert recordings:** Require **certified transcription** and **full, unedited disclosure**; publication only with explicit permission.

- ##### Model wording (Practitioner-aligned)

**EX107 add-on (request):**  
> “The applicant also seeks permission for **post-approval publication** of an **anonymised** version of the authorised transcript, to be exercised only **in accordance with any Transparency Order or further directions of the court**.”

**Transparency / permission order (publication):**  
> “Upon completion and approval, the applicant may **publish an anonymised transcript** consistent with this Order. **No identification of the child(ren) or family.** Treatment of professional identifiers **as directed by the court.** Any publication beyond this scope requires permission. **Breach may constitute contempt of court.** Liberty to apply.”



### 7.7 Conclusion

The JustAnswer dataset (N=12) confirms the **reality gap**: a median **77-day** transcript process, with **67%** of queries citing delays and **58%** cost barriers. Triangulated with Warners (47-week cases), Byline Times (50,000+ backlog), and FOI ("no data held"), it reveals **systemic opacity** — not malice, but **banal procedural friction**.

Anecdotes expose **LIP vulnerability**: users pay £180+ for records they cannot verify, while courts refuse raw audio. This undermines TIG goals (2022) and TOJ Objectives (2024).

**Least-resistance reform** — clearer forms, visible SLAs, provisional release — can be delivered **now**, within existing frameworks, while laying groundwork for **presumptive openness**.

## 8. Policy Implications: Transcripts as Drivers of Systemic Change

Transcripts aren't ancillary; they're pivotal. Experts like those in NatCen's evaluation argue they underpin scrutiny, with TIG's data sub-group advancing collection for outcomes (NatCen, 2025). AI integration could slash costs/delays, per MoJ explorations (MoJ, 2025c). Repealing parental presumptions signals responsiveness, but without transcript metrics, biases persist unchecked (MoJ, 2025b).

## 8. Low-Resistance Interventions: Actionable Pathways Forward

To catalyse change:

- **Data Collection:** TIG mandate quarterly anonymised metrics on requests/delays.
- **Procedures:** Automate approvals; pilot AI drafts for speed/accuracy.
- **User Support:** Free/low-cost for vulnerable; anonymised database for precedents.
- **Contracts:** Add SLAs, open-data clauses; accelerate AI rollout.

Key phrases: "Family courts reinvent the wheel—transcripts are the blueprint." "One transcript unveils more truth than 100 reporters." "No revolution needed—just transcripts." "Transparency ignites with the spoken word." "Transcribe to transform justice."

- Encourage voluntary publication of authorised transcripts already obtained under EX107 — a low-resistance path to transparency requiring no legislative reform.

## 9. Conclusion: A Call to Action for Verifiable Justice

The family justice crisis demands bold, evidence-driven reform. Transparency, evolved since 2021, holds promise, but transcripts are its foundation. By implementing these interventions, we can reduce delays, expose harms, and restore trust—safeguarding children. Policymakers: Prioritise transcript reforms in TIG agendas. Stakeholders: Advocate via petitions to MoJ or MPs. Join the push—contact transparency@judiciary.uk or support NatCen evaluations. Together, unlock justice for a better world.
