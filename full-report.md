# Abstract

The family justice system in England and Wales is in systemic crisis. Over 50,000 cases remain unresolved, 4,000 children await decisions for more than two years, and domestic abuse features in 90% of private law proceedings — yet is frequently minimised or ignored (National Audit Office, 2025; Hencke, 2025; Bureau of Investigative Journalism, 2025). This article contends that these symptoms — chronic delay, fragmented governance, entrenched “pro-contact” bias, and profound human harm — are not intractable. They can be addressed through **transparency**, with **court transcripts** as its indispensable foundation.

Drawing on official reports, Ministry of Justice statistics, Freedom of Information data on transcript processing, and stakeholder testimony, this analysis advances a **least-resistance reform hypothesis**:  
> **Transparency is the invisible force capable of resolving multiple crises simultaneously, and transcripts are its operational bedrock.**

The article proceeds in four stages: (1) logical mapping of crisis symptoms to transparency deficits; (2) critical viability testing of transcript improvement as a low-cost, high-impact intervention; (3) practice-based assessment of current transcription access, approval, and publication barriers; and (4) synthesis of gaps followed by **pragmatic, incremental solutions** — e.g., **form updates**, **court-to-transcriber timeline clarity**, and **provisional transcript release upon transcription, with simultaneous judicial and party review during the appeal window**.

These **least-resistance reforms** leverage existing infrastructure (TIG pilots, TOJ principles) to close the “reality gap” between courtroom dialogue and recorded outcome. Transcripts do not merely document — they **verify truth, accelerate resolutions, expose bias, and restore trust**. This is not a call for revolution. It is a call for a transcript.

## 1. The Crises: Symptoms of Systemic Failure

### 1.1. The Crisis of Timeliness: Chronic Backlogs and Delays

The principle that justice delayed is justice denied is acutely relevant in family law, where protracted uncertainty inflicts substantial harm on children and parents. The family court system is currently failing to deliver timely justice, with case backlogs reaching critical levels.

The scale of the problem is stark. A recent report from the National Audit Office (NAO) revealed nearly 50,000 unresolved family court cases, with the most severe instances seeing around 4,000 children waiting over two years for critical decisions about their future (NAO, 2025). This systemic delay is not a recent phenomenon. According to Warners Solicitors (2024), private children law cases—those determining where children live and who they have contact with—were taking an average of 47 weeks to conclude in 2024, up from 45 weeks between July and September 2023 and continuing an upward trend seen over the last seven years.

The human impact of these statistics is immense. Law Society president Nick Emmerson highlighted that over 80,000 children were caught in these family backlogs, living in a state of prolonged instability (The Law Society, 2023). Even statutory targets are being missed; the 26-week time limit for resolving most public law cases, introduced in 2014 to bring swiftness to proceedings involving child protection, has not been met since its inception. Recent data from the President's Chambers View (April 2025) shows partial progress through the **Public Law Outline (PLO) relaunch** — a judicial initiative to reimpose the 26-week target across all care cases — with 37% of public law cases concluded within 26 weeks in Q4 2024, the highest since pre-pandemic levels. However, regional disparities persist (e.g., 70 weeks in London vs. 18 weeks in Wales), and the system remains far from the statutory benchmark.

### 1.2. Fragmented Governance and Weak Accountability

A core driver of this inefficiency is a fractured and incoherent governance structure. Responsibility for the family justice system is dispersed across multiple government bodies, with **no single organisation accountable for overall performance**:

- **The Ministry of Justice (MoJ)**: Responsible for private family law policy.
- **The Department for Education (DfE)**: Responsible for public family law policy.
- **HM Courts and Tribunals Service (HMCTS)**: Responsible for the administration of the courts.
- **Cafcass (Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service)**: Represents children in family court cases.

This dispersal leads to fragmented decision-making and weak accountability. The ministerial-led **Family Justice Board (FJB)**, established to foster effective collaboration, has been hampered by frequent turnover of its ministerial chairs and the absence of a cohesive, long-term strategy. At the local level, **Local Family Justice Boards (LFJBs)** — non-statutory bodies intended to drive improvement by bringing together local practitioners — **lack dedicated resources and formal powers**. They **do not publish findings**, **do not report to Parliament**, and have **no enforcement mechanism**. They **share local insights informally with stakeholders** but **cannot mandate change or enforce standards**, resulting in highly variable effectiveness and limited oversight, contributing to inconsistencies in performance across different regions.

### 1.3. The Data Deficit: A Barrier to Evidence-Based Policy

The ability to diagnose problems and design effective solutions is severely hampered by a systemic data deficit. Significant gaps in data collection prevent a full understanding of the system's performance, its costs, and its impact on users.

According to the NAO, it is not yet possible to track a child’s journey through the entire family justice process, making it difficult to identify bottlenecks or measure end-to-end outcomes (NAO, 2025). There are also critical weaknesses in data collection that limit systemic insight — for example, the absence of comprehensive tracking of case progression, resource allocation, or long-term outcomes for families.

These high-level systemic failures of timeliness, governance, and data create a dysfunctional environment that critically undermines the court’s ability to deliver just, timely, and verifiable outcomes — the very foundation of family stability.

## 2. Reforms Amid Persistent Hurdles: Signs of Progress and Gaps

Reform efforts offer glimmers of hope. The Family Court’s Annual Report for October 2023 to September 2024 acknowledges the "substantial backlog" but spotlights initiatives like the relaunched Public Law Outline (PLO), designed to enforce pre-proceedings management and the 26-week timeline (Judiciary, 2024). The Pathfinder pilot, emphasising child-centred approaches via early Child Impact Reports from CAFCASS or Cafcass Cymru, is now live in North Wales, South East Wales, Dorset, and Birmingham, with backlogs of legacy cases nearly cleared and average durations reduced by 11 weeks (Judiciary, 2024).

In his April 2025 "View from The President’s Chambers," Sir Andrew McFarlane, President of the Family Division, commended PLO progress: 37% of public law cases concluded within 26 weeks in late 2024, the highest pre-pandemic figure, with a 4% drop in outstanding cases (McFarlane, 2025). Yet London persists with chronic backlogs due to resource deficits and cultural resistance, prompting a Local Practice Note (McFarlane, 2025). The PAC's September 2025 report underscores these hurdles, criticising insufficient judges, social workers, and funding (House of Commons Public Accounts Committee, 2025). In response, the government announced in October 2025 plans to repeal the presumption of parental involvement in the Children Act 1989 to better protect children from abusive parents—a direct address to pro-contact biases (MoJ, 2025b).

**These reforms — PLO, Pathfinder, repeal of presumption — are powerful in isolation. But they operate in silos. The critical question is not *what* they fix, but *how* they can be unified under one principle.** The answer is **transparency** — the invisible force that turns isolated fixes into systemic change. This article's hypothesis holds that transparency, with transcripts as its bedrock, is the missing link.

## 3. Transparency as a Catalyst: Evolution and Implementation

The transparency agenda did not emerge in isolation. It gained momentum with **Sir Andrew McFarlane's 2021 Transparency Review** ("Confidence and Confidentiality"), initiated in 2019 to balance child privacy with public trust in family justice amid growing criticism of opacity (McFarlane, 2021). McFarlane, as President of the Family Division, led the review panel, concluding that the "veil of secrecy" fueled mistrust and recommending greater media access and judgment publication.

Thanks to this review, the **Transparency Implementation Group (TIG)** was formed in December 2021, comprising over 30 members from judiciary, legal, and media sectors (Judiciary, 2022). TIG's work is not a side thought but **increasingly the guiding light for family court reform**, as evidenced by its integration into core policy. However, it is not yet fully positioned as the comprehensive solution to crises — a gap this article addresses by arguing transparency's "invisible force" potential.

Practically, TIG's sub-groups drive implementation: press reporting pilots (launched November 2022 in three courts, expanded nationwide by 2025), data collection, media engagement, judgment anonymisation, and financial remedies transparency (Judiciary, 2022). Accredited journalists and legal bloggers can now attend and report on private proceedings under anonymity rules, fostering trust (Judiciary, 2025a). The **Transparency & Open Justice Board (TOJ)** affirms open justice as the default, promoting access to case info, documents, and hearings (Judiciary, undated).

Expert views reinforce transparency's catalytic role: NatCen's 2025 pilot evaluation shows improved public understanding without privacy breaches (NatCen, 2025). The Justice Committee (2022) advocates enhanced media access and transcripts for democratic oversight. The MoJ's 2025 Call for Evidence urges better data and document sharing (MoJ, 2025c). **FOI (Freedom of Information)** requests reveal ongoing barriers, like transcript denials due to recording issues (Walker, 2025).

Challenges persist: inconsistent data, resistance, and a "data void" (House of Commons Justice Committee, 2023). Yet, transparency is evolving from peripheral to central philosophy, **with this article proposing it as the unifying force directly responding to the symptoms of crises** — though not yet fully harnessed in current policy frameworks.

## 4. Logical Mapping: Crisis Symptoms → Transparency Deficits → Transcripts as Bedrock

The abstract promised **logical mapping** — here it is. This section **does not introduce new crises**. It **takes the crises already established in Section 1** and **maps them directly to transparency deficits**, then **shows how transcripts resolve both**.

To begin, we must establish **how transcripts are the bedrock of transparency**. Transcripts provide the verbatim, objective record of proceedings — the raw material for scrutiny, data, and reform. Without them, transparency is superficial: summaries can distort, notes can omit, and judgments can diverge from what was said. The hypothesis assumes transcripts are viable — but to test it, we map crises to deficits, then deficits to transcripts.

| Crisis Symptom (Section 1) | Transparency Deficit | How Transcripts Resolve It | Evidence |
|----------------------------|----------------------|----------------------------|----------|
| **Chronic delays** (47 weeks private, 44 weeks public) | No public scrutiny of hearing inefficiencies | Verbatim records expose bottlenecks, enable templates, speed appeals | Warners Solicitors (2024); Walker FOI (2025) |
| **Fragmented governance** (MoJ/DfE/HMCTS/Cafcass silos) | No unified reporting across bodies | Transcripts create common dataset for all stakeholders | TIG Progress Report (2022) |
| **Pro-contact bias** (90% abuse cases, FFHs only 3–4%) | Hidden proceedings shield flawed reasoning | Irrefutable record of oral evidence, prevents minimisation | Bureau of Investigative Journalism (2025) |
| **Data deficit** (no child journey tracking) | No objective source for metrics | Transcripts = raw data for delay, outcome, bias analysis | NAO (2025); TIG Data Sub-group (2022) |
| **Human harm** (re-traumatisation, instability) | Lack of verifiable outcomes | Accurate records reduce re-hearings, enable trust | FLAG DV (2024); Byline Times (2025) |

**Conclusion of Mapping**:  
> **Every crisis symptom is a transparency deficit. Every transparency deficit is a transcript deficit.**

### TIG Sub-Groups: Transcripts as Logical Bedrock

TIG's five sub-groups **depend on transcripts** — not as an add-on, but as **operational necessity**:

| TIG Sub-Group | Transparency Goal | Transcript Role | Source |
|---------------|-------------------|-----------------|--------|
| **Press reporting** | Accurate, anonymised journalism | Verbatim record prevents misreporting | Transparency Project (2021) |
| **Data collection** | Reliable metrics on delays/abuse | Only source for objective data | TIG Data Sub-group (2022) |
| **Media engagement** | Safe public sharing | Redacted transcripts = controlled openness | Justice Committee (2022) |
| **Judgment publication** | Published rulings reflect reality | Ensures written judgment matches oral | Judiciary (undated) |
| **Financial remedies** | Prevent post-hearing disputes | Captures verbal agreements | Judiciary (2022) |

**Without transcripts, TIG fails.**

### The Reality Gap: Defined and Proven

| Gap | Evidence |
|-----|----------|
| **Transcript inaccessibility** | FOI: Denials for "recording issues" (Walker, 2025) |
| **No national data** | MoJ admits no central tracking (Walker, 2025) |
| **Appeal delays** | Provisional release blocked by judicial approval |

**This is the "reality gap"** — the disconnect between **what is said in court** and **what is recorded, shared, or used**. This gap tests the hypothesis: if transcripts are inaccessible, transparency cannot resolve crises. But as the mapping shows, they are viable — with least-resistance fixes.

## 5. The Data Void Exposed: Lessons from an FOI Request

To test the hypothesis that transcripts serve as the bedrock of transparency, a logical starting point is to examine existing data on transcripts themselves — their availability, processing, and role in family law proceedings. However, as this section demonstrates, a profound "data void" exists, as revealed by J. Walker's May 20, 2025, Freedom of Information (FOI) request to the Ministry of Justice (MoJ). This request sought aggregate statistics (total requests, funding types, processing times, denials, and technical issues) for April 2024–2025, targeting data that should be routinely held for accountability purposes.
By October 26, 2025, after processing and an internal review, the response was partial and restrictive:

National statistics were withheld under Section 12(2) of the FOI Act 2000, citing cost exemption (limit £600).
For Newcastle Civil and Family Court and Tribunals Centre specifics, data was "not held" due to no "legal or business requirement."
Operational details were incomplete, with breakdowns by funding type (public/private) provided but no comprehensive metrics on denials or issues.
The review upheld these decisions, breaching Section 16's duty to assist by not suggesting ways to refine the request (Walker, 2025). This opacity directly contravenes TIG's data collection goals and Justice Committee recommendations for mandatory metrics to establish baseline accountability (TIG Progress Report, 2022; House of Commons Justice Committee, 2022).

Defining Transcripts in Family Law Proceedings
Before delving deeper, clarity is needed on what transcripts encompass in family law. Transcripts are verbatim records of oral proceedings — the word-for-word documentation of what is said during hearings, including:

Oral arguments by parties or counsel.
Witness testimony and evidence presentation.
Judicial comments, questions, and oral judgments (where not delivered in writing).
Any oral orders or directions given by the court.

They do not include written submissions like skeleton arguments — these are pre-prepared documents outlining parties' positions, submitted in advance and not spoken verbatim in court. Skeleton arguments are not transcribed but could be published separately as part of transparency initiatives to provide context for hearings (House of Commons Justice Committee, 2022). This article focuses exclusively on transcripts of oral proceedings, as they capture the dynamic, unfiltered reality of court interactions — the core of the "reality gap."
The FOI's revelation of a data void underscores a critical question: How can transparency reforms succeed without basic metrics on transcripts, the primary source of verifiable court activity? This gap not only hinders reform but perpetuates crises like delays (e.g., untracked transcription backlogs) and bias (e.g., no data on how oral evidence is recorded in abuse cases). Addressing it requires mandatory reporting, aligning with TIG's data sub-group aims — a least-resistance step to prove the hypothesis viable.

## 6. Analysing Barriers: Processes, Experiences, and Procurement

To identify low-resistance mechanisms for boosting transcript production/publication, this analysis draws on documents, user anecdotes, and procurement.

### 6.1 Documentary Analysis: Forms and Procedures

Requests use Forms EX105/EX107, requiring judicial approval for non-public funding. Guidelines stipulate 10-15 working days, but exceedances arise from recordings or backlogs. Lack of enforcement fosters inconsistencies (Walker, 2025).

### 6.2 Anecdotal Evidence: User Experiences on X

X reveals stark divergences: Costs reach $1,000s for transcripts, psychologists, or guardians, deterring appeals. Survivors note expense hinders appeals of erroneous decisions; ready transcripts would ease this. Calls for routine transcripts/records to litigants underscore data needs. These align with 2025 IT failure reports.

### 6.3 Procurement and Providers: Contracts and Terms

MoJ's £20m 2023 framework with eight suppliers (e.g., Auscript, Opus 2) prioritises cost over speed, lacking delay penalties or transparency clauses. A July 2025 tender and August session signal updates. AI trials aim for 99.5% accuracy to rival humans, potentially revolutionising access.

## 7. Policy Implications: Transcripts as Drivers of Systemic Change

Transcripts aren't ancillary; they're pivotal. Experts like those in NatCen's evaluation argue they underpin scrutiny, with TIG's data sub-group advancing collection for outcomes (NatCen, 2025). AI integration could slash costs/delays, per MoJ explorations (MoJ, 2025c). Repealing parental presumptions signals responsiveness, but without transcript metrics, biases persist unchecked (MoJ, 2025b).

## 8. Low-Resistance Interventions: Actionable Pathways Forward

To catalyse change:

- **Data Collection:** TIG mandate quarterly anonymised metrics on requests/delays.
- **Procedures:** Automate approvals; pilot AI drafts for speed/accuracy.
- **User Support:** Free/low-cost for vulnerable; anonymised database for precedents.
- **Contracts:** Add SLAs, open-data clauses; accelerate AI rollout.

Key phrases: "Family courts reinvent the wheel—transcripts are the blueprint." "One transcript unveils more truth than 100 reporters." "No revolution needed—just transcripts." "Transparency ignites with the spoken word." "Transcribe to transform justice."

## 9. Conclusion: A Call to Action for Verifiable Justice

The family justice crisis demands bold, evidence-driven reform. Transparency, evolved since 2021, holds promise, but transcripts are its foundation. By implementing these interventions, we can reduce delays, expose harms, and restore trust—safeguarding children. Policymakers: Prioritise transcript reforms in TIG agendas. Stakeholders: Advocate via petitions to MoJ or MPs. Join the push—contact transparency@judiciary.uk or support NatCen evaluations. Together, unlock justice for a better world.
