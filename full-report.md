# Unlocking Family Justice: Transcripts as the Keystone for Transparency, Accountability, and Reform

## Introduction

The Family Courts of the United Kingdom are entrusted with one of society’s most profound responsibilities: to protect the welfare of children, adjudicate on the most intimate aspects of family life, and provide a forum for the just resolution of disputes. However, the central thesis of this analysis is that the family justice system is currently in the grip of a multi-faceted crisis. It is a system beset by systemic dysfunction, a profound failure to adequately address domestic abuse, and, as a consequence, severe and damaging outcomes for the children and families it is designed to serve. This article will examine the key areas of this crisis, including the chronic operational backlogs that delay justice, the fragmented governance that undermines accountability, the pervasive "pro-contact culture" that can compromise safety, and the tangible human cost of these failings. Despite ongoing and well-intentioned reform efforts, these deep-seated problems persist. Drawing upon official reports from bodies such as the National Audit Office, data from third-sector organisations, and stakeholder testimony, this article provides a systems-level analysis of these interlocking crises and the challenging path towards meaningful reform. **These systemic issues also amplify the "reality gap" in court transcripts, where delays and inaccuracies in verbatim records hinder appeals and perpetuate unfair outcomes, underscoring the need for improved transcription processes as a key reform area.**

## 1. The Anatomy of Systemic Dysfunction: Delays, Fragmentation, and Data Deficits

Before examining specific failings in the administration of justice, particularly in cases involving domestic abuse, it is crucial to understand the foundational operational crises that undermine the entire family justice system. The strategic importance of a well-functioning infrastructure—one that is timely, accountable, and evidence-led—cannot be overstated. Chronic delays, fragmented governance, and a severe lack of coherent data create an environment where effective and fair decision-making is fundamentally compromised, creating the conditions for the more specific crises detailed later in this analysis.

### 1.1. The Crisis of Timeliness: Chronic Backlogs and Delays

The principle that justice delayed is justice denied is acutely relevant in family law, where protracted uncertainty inflicts substantial harm on children and parents. The family court system is currently failing to deliver timely justice, with case backlogs reaching critical levels.

The scale of the problem is stark. A recent report from the National Audit Office (NAO) revealed nearly 50,000 unresolved family court cases, with the most severe instances seeing around 4,000 children waiting over two years for critical decisions about their future. This systemic delay is not a recent phenomenon. **According to Warners Solicitors (2024), private children law cases—those determining where children live and who they have contact with—were taking an average of 47 weeks to conclude in 2024, up from 45 weeks between July and September 2023 and continuing an upward trend seen over the last seven years.**

The human impact of these statistics is immense. Law Society president Nick Emmerson highlighted that over 80,000 children were caught in these family backlogs, living in a state of prolonged instability. Even statutory targets are being missed; the 26-week time limit for resolving most public law cases, introduced in 2014 to bring swiftness to proceedings involving child protection, has not been met since its inception. **Recent data from the President's Chambers View (April 2025) shows partial progress through the Public Law Outline relaunch, with 37% of public law cases concluded within 26 weeks in Q4 2024, but regional disparities persist (e.g., 70 weeks in London vs. 18 weeks in Wales). These delays not only prolong trauma but also exacerbate transcription inaccuracies, as rushed hearings lead to incomplete or erroneous verbatim records essential for appeals.**

**To illustrate, consider the following table of average case durations:**

| Case Type     | Average Duration (Weeks, 2024) | Statutory Target (Weeks) | % Resolved Within Target (Q4 2024) |
|---------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Private Law   | 47                             | N/A                      | N/A                                |
| Public Law    | 44                             | 26                       | 37%                                |

### 1.2. Fragmented Governance and Weak Accountability

A core driver of this inefficiency is a fractured and incoherent governance structure. Responsibility for the family justice system is dispersed across multiple government bodies, with no single organisation accountable for overall performance. Key responsibilities are split between:

- **The Ministry of Justice (MoJ)**: Responsible for private family law policy.
- **The Department for Education (DfE)**: Responsible for public family law policy.
- **HM Courts and Tribunals Service (HMCTS)**: Responsible for the administration of the courts.
- **Cafcass (Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service)**: Represents children in family court cases.

This dispersal leads to fragmented decision-making and weak accountability. The ministerial-led Family Justice Board (FJB), established to foster effective collaboration, has been hampered by a frequent turnover of its ministerial chairs and the absence of a cohesive, long-term strategy for the system.

This lack of centralised strategic direction is mirrored at the local level. The Local Family Justice Boards (LFJBs), intended to drive improvement by bringing together local practitioners, are non-statutory bodies with no dedicated resources. Their effectiveness is highly variable and subject to limited oversight, contributing to inconsistencies in performance across different regions. **This fragmentation extends to transcript processing, where inconsistent oversight leads to delays and denials in requests, as evidenced by recent Freedom of Information data showing exceeded timeframes and technical denials (Court Transcript Processing Performance Data, 2025).**

### 1.3. The Data Deficit: A Barrier to Evidence-Based Policy

The ability to diagnose problems and design effective solutions is severely hampered by a systemic data deficit. Significant gaps in data collection prevent a full understanding of the system's performance, its costs, and its impact on users.

According to the NAO, it is not yet possible to track a child’s journey through the entire family justice process, making it difficult to identify bottlenecks or measure end-to-end outcomes. There are also critical weaknesses in demographic data collection. For instance, HMCTS does not collect data on the ethnicity of the children it supports, which prevents any meaningful analysis of how the system affects particular demographic groups and whether there are issues of disproportionality.

The need for a more coherent approach is widely recognised. The Transparency Implementation Group, a body established to improve openness in the courts, has outlined six core questions that a comprehensive data strategy must answer, ranging from what happens to families before they enter the court system to the ultimate outcomes of judicial decisions. Until such a strategy is implemented, policymaking will remain reactive rather than evidence-based. **These data gaps also obscure transcription error rates, limiting reforms to ensure accurate records that bridge the reality gap in proceedings.**

These high-level systemic failures of timeliness, governance, and data create a dysfunctional environment that critically undermines the court’s ability to handle its most sensitive and challenging cases, most notably those involving domestic abuse.

## 2. Reforms Amid Persistent Hurdles: Signs of Progress and Gaps

Reform efforts offer glimmers of hope. The Family Court’s Annual Report for October 2023 to September 2024 acknowledges the "substantial backlog" but spotlights initiatives like the relaunched Public Law Outline (PLO), designed to enforce pre-proceedings management and the 26-week timeline (Judiciary, 2024). The Pathfinder pilot, emphasising child-centred approaches via early Child Impact Reports from CAFCASS or Cafcass Cymru, is now live in North Wales, South East Wales, Dorset, and Birmingham, with backlogs of legacy cases nearly cleared and average durations reduced by 11 weeks (Judiciary, 2024).

In his April 2025 "View from The President’s Chambers," Sir Andrew McFarlane, President of the Family Division, commended PLO progress: 37% of public law cases concluded within 26 weeks in late 2024, the highest pre-pandemic figure, with a 4% drop in outstanding cases (McFarlane, 2025). Yet London persists with chronic backlogs due to resource deficits and cultural resistance, prompting a Local Practice Note (McFarlane, 2025). The PAC's September 2025 report underscores these hurdles, criticising insufficient judges, social workers, and funding (House of Commons Public Accounts Committee, 2025). In response, the government announced in October 2025 plans to repeal the presumption of parental involvement in the Children Act 1989 to better protect children from abusive parents—a direct address to pro-contact biases (MoJ, 2025b).

## 3. Transparency as a Catalyst: Evolution and Implementation

Transparency stands as a transformative policy tool to rebuild trust and spur reform. It gained traction with Sir Andrew McFarlane's 2021 Transparency Review, aiming to reconcile privacy with accountability in opaque family courts (McFarlane, 2021). The **Transparency Implementation Group (TIG)**, formed in December 2021, advances this through five sub-groups: press attendance and reporting (pilot), data collection, media engagement, judgment anonymisation/publication, and financial remedies transparency (Judiciary, 2022). TIG's October 2022 report stresses building media-court trust for reliable, anonymised reporting to boost public confidence (Judiciary, 2022).

Practically, accredited journalists and legal bloggers can now attend and report on private proceedings under restrictions, following a pilot starting November 2022 in three courts (Judiciary, 2022). By January 27, 2025, this expanded nationwide and became permanent, with extensions to February 2025 in some areas (Judiciary, 2025a). The Transparency & Open Justice Board's Key Objectives affirm open justice as default, promoting access to listings, documents, and hearings (Judiciary, undated). The Justice Committee's 2022 report advocates enhanced media access and transcripts to sustain democratic oversight amid declining reporting (House of Commons Justice Committee, 2022). The MoJ's January 2025 Call for Evidence summary echoes this, urging better data and document access for trust-building (MoJ, 2025c).

Expert views reinforce transparency's potential: NatCen's 2025 evaluation of the pilot highlights improved public understanding without compromising privacy (NatCen, 2025). Legal commentators note it exposes biases, accelerates resolutions, and prevents harm via scrutiny (Transparency Project, 2023b). However, TIG (2022) and the Justice Committee (2023) identify a "data void" as a barrier, making family courts the UK's least visible jurisdiction. Challenges include inconsistent data, FOI barriers, and resistance, stalling full impact (House of Commons Justice Committee, 2023).

**Transcripts are the logical bedrock of each TIG sub-group**:

- **Press reporting**: Transcripts provide verbatim records, enabling accurate, anonymised journalism without reliance on notes (Transparency Project, 2021).
- **Data collection**: Transcripts are the only source for reliable metrics on delays, abuse prevalence, and outcomes (Transparency Project, 2022).
- **Media engagement**: Transcripts allow safe, redacted sharing with the public (House of Commons Justice Committee, 2022).
- **Judgment publication**: Transcripts ensure published rulings reflect actual proceedings (Judiciary, undated).
- **Financial remedies**: Transcripts document verbal agreements, preventing disputes (Judiciary, 2022).

Without transcripts, all sub-groups lack the **objective, complete record** necessary for transparency.

## 4. Transcripts: The Achilles' Heel and Foundation of Transparency

This article argues that transparency's efficacy depends on transcripts as its evidentiary bedrock. Without routine, accurate, accessible verbatim records, initiatives like media reporting and data publication falter. Transcripts enable reusable precedents, abuse evidence verification, and metrics—addressing the crisis logically: delays via efficiency, biases via scrutiny, inaccessibility via resources.

| Symptom of the Crisis | How Increased Transparency Addresses It | How Transcripts Help Address It |
|---------------|-----------------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Chronic delays (public law 36–41 weeks; >4,000 children >2 years) | Scrutinises processes for efficiency reforms (NAO, 2025). | Templates reduce reinvention (NAO, 2025). |
| Unmet 26-week limit since 2014 | Exposes flaws for enforcement (Children and Families Act 2014, s 14(2); NAO, 2025). | Highlights bottlenecks for reforms (Children and Families Act 2014, s 14(2); NAO, 2025). |
| Unresolved cases (~47,662) | Monitors workloads for allocation (NAO, 2025). | Precedents clear backlogs (NAO, 2025). |
| Domestic abuse mishandling (90% private cases) | Reveals issues via open proceedings (Bureau of Investigative Journalism, 2025). | Irrefutable testimony evidence (Bureau of Investigative Journalism, 2025). |
| Pro-contact culture | Scrutinises patterns for bias shifts (Bureau of Investigative Journalism, 2025). | Exposes decisions for reform (Bureau of Investigative Journalism, 2025). |
| Advice deserts/access barriers | Empowers self-represented with info (Byrom, 2024). | Free resources for preparation (Byrom, 2024). |
| Digital exclusion (33%) | Non-digital reporting access (Byrom, 2024). | Low-tech summaries as precedents (Byrom, 2024). |
| Transcript inaccessibility | Oversees admin for efficiency (Walker, 2025). | Routine/free access (Walker, 2025). |
| Data void/lack of accountability | Mandates metrics (Walker, 2025). | Data sources for metrics (Walker, 2025). |
| Financial inefficiency (£1.8bn) | Identifies cost drivers (NAO, 2025). | Template reuse cuts costs (NAO, 2025). |
| Re-traumatisation | Swift resolutions prioritised (Warners Solicitors, 2024). | Accurate documentation for outcomes (Warners Solicitors, 2024). |
| Public trust erosion | Visible decisions for oversight (McFarlane, 2025). | Verifiable evidence for corrections (McFarlane, 2025). |

## 5. The Data Void Exposed: Lessons from an FOI Request

J. Walker's May 20, 2025, FOI request to the MoJ illuminates the transcript data blackout. Seeking aggregates (requests, funding, times, denials, issues) for April 2024–2025, it targeted existing data. By October 26, 2025, processed with internal review, it yielded partial responses: Section 12(2) cost exemption for national stats (£600 limit), data "not held" for Newcastle specifics due to no "legal or business requirement," and incomplete operational details. The review upheld these, breaching Section 16 assistance duty. This opacity contravenes TIG's data goals and Justice Committee recommendations, demanding mandatory metrics for baseline accountability (Walker, 2025; House of Commons Justice Committee, 2022).

## 6. Analysing Barriers: Processes, Experiences, and Procurement

To identify low-resistance mechanisms for boosting transcript production/publication, this analysis draws on documents, user anecdotes, and procurement.

### 6.1 Documentary Analysis: Forms and Procedures

Requests use Forms EX105/EX107, requiring judicial approval for non-public funding. Guidelines stipulate 10-15 working days, but exceedances arise from recordings or backlogs. Lack of enforcement fosters inconsistencies (Walker, 2025).

### 6.2 Anecdotal Evidence: User Experiences on X

X reveals stark divergences: Costs reach $1,000s for transcripts, psychologists, or guardians, deterring appeals. Survivors note expense hinders appeals of erroneous decisions; ready transcripts would ease this. Calls for routine transcripts/records to litigants underscore data needs. These align with 2025 IT failure reports.

### 6.3 Procurement and Providers: Contracts and Terms

MoJ's £20m 2023 framework with eight suppliers (e.g., Auscript, Opus 2) prioritises cost over speed, lacking delay penalties or transparency clauses. A July 2025 tender and August session signal updates. AI trials aim for 99.5% accuracy to rival humans, potentially revolutionising access.

## 7. Policy Implications: Transcripts as Drivers of Systemic Change

Transcripts aren't ancillary; they're pivotal. Experts like those in NatCen's evaluation argue they underpin scrutiny, with TIG's data sub-group advancing collection for outcomes (NatCen, 2025). AI integration could slash costs/delays, per MoJ explorations (MoJ, 2025c). Repealing parental presumptions signals responsiveness, but without transcript metrics, biases persist unchecked (MoJ, 2025b).

## 8. Low-Resistance Interventions: Actionable Pathways Forward

To catalyse change:

- **Data Collection:** TIG mandate quarterly anonymised metrics on requests/delays.
- **Procedures:** Automate approvals; pilot AI drafts for speed/accuracy.
- **User Support:** Free/low-cost for vulnerable; anonymised database for precedents.
- **Contracts:** Add SLAs, open-data clauses; accelerate AI rollout.

Key phrases: "Family courts reinvent the wheel—transcripts are the blueprint." "One transcript unveils more truth than 100 reporters." "No revolution needed—just transcripts." "Transparency ignites with the spoken word." "Transcribe to transform justice."

## 9. Conclusion: A Call to Action for Verifiable Justice

The family justice crisis demands bold, evidence-driven reform. Transparency, evolved since 2021, holds promise, but transcripts are its foundation. By implementing these interventions, we can reduce delays, expose harms, and restore trust—safeguarding children. Policymakers: Prioritise transcript reforms in TIG agendas. Stakeholders: Advocate via petitions to MoJ or MPs. Join the push—contact transparency@judiciary.uk or support NatCen evaluations. Together, unlock justice for a better world.
