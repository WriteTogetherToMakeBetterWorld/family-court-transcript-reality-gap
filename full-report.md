## Abstract

The family justice system in England and Wales is in crisis: 50,000 unresolved cases, 4,000 children waiting over two years, and 90% of private law cases involving domestic abuse (NAO, 2025; Bureau of Investigative Journalism, 2025). Despite transparency reforms since 2021, systemic delays, pro-contact bias, and a "data void" persist. This article argues that **transcripts are the evidentiary bedrock** of meaningful transparency. Using official reports, FOI data, and analysis of the Transparency Implementation Group (TIG), it demonstrates how transcripts enable each of TIG’s five sub-groups. Low-resistance interventions are proposed to prioritise transcript access, production, and publication.

## 1. Introduction: The Deepening Crisis

The family justice system in England and Wales is characterised by chronic delays, backlogs, and systemic failures that cause lasting harm to children and families. The National Audit Office (NAO) reported nearly 50,000 unresolved cases by December 2024, including 10,121 public law and 37,541 private law applications (NAO, 2025). Ministry of Justice statistics show 65,709 new cases in Q2 2025, with over 4,000 children waiting more than two years for hearings — far exceeding the statutory 26-week limit under the Children and Families Act 2014, s 14(2) (MoJ, 2025a).

Domestic abuse features in 90% of private law cases, yet a pro-contact culture often prioritises parental involvement over child safety (Bureau of Investigative Journalism, 2025; Transparency Project, 2023a). Digital exclusion affects 33% of the population, and "advice deserts" limit access to support (Byrom, 2024). Appeals routinely fail due to delayed, costly, or unavailable transcripts (Walker, 2025; Transparency Project, 2021).

The annual cost is £1.8 billion, with legal aid per case doubling to £12,000 (NAO, 2025). Regional disparities are stark: 18 weeks in Wales vs. 70 weeks in London (House of Commons Public Accounts Committee, 2025). This is **systemic re-traumatisation**.

## 2. Reforms Amid Persistent Hurdles

Reform efforts show progress but fall short. The Family Court Annual Report (2023–2024) highlights the Public Law Outline (PLO) relaunch and Pathfinder pilot, reducing legacy backlogs and average durations by 11 weeks in pilot courts (Judiciary, 2024). In April 2025, Sir Andrew McFarlane reported 37% of public law cases concluding within 26 weeks — the highest since pre-pandemic — with a 4% drop in outstanding cases (McFarlane, 2025).

However, London remains a "black spot" due to resource deficits and cultural resistance (McFarlane, 2025). The PAC criticised "lack of urgency" and insufficient judges and social workers (House of Commons Public Accounts Committee, 2025). In October 2025, the government announced repeal of the parental involvement presumption in the Children Act 1989 to address pro-contact bias (MoJ, 2025b).

## 3. Transparency as Catalyst: The Role of TIG

Transparency gained momentum with McFarlane’s 2021 Review (McFarlane, 2021). The **Transparency Implementation Group (TIG)**, formed in December 2021, advances this via five sub-groups (Judiciary, 2022):

1. **Press attendance and reporting (pilot)**  
2. **Data collection**  
3. **Media engagement**  
4. **Anonymisation and publication of judgments**  
5. **Transparency in financial remedy cases**

The pilot, launched in November 2022, expanded nationwide in January 2025 (Judiciary, 2025a). The Transparency & Open Justice Board affirms open justice as default (Judiciary, undated).

**Transcripts are the logical bedrock of each sub-group:**

- **Press reporting**: Without transcripts, journalists rely on notes — risking inaccuracy and anonymity breaches (Transparency Project, 2021).
- **Data collection**: Transcripts are the only verbatim source for metrics on delays, abuse, and outcomes (Transparency Project, 2022).
- **Media engagement**: Transcripts enable safe, redacted sharing with the public (House of Commons Justice Committee, 2022).
- **Judgment publication**: Anonymised transcripts ensure published rulings reflect actual proceedings (Judiciary, undated).
- **Financial remedies**: Transcripts document verbal agreements, preventing disputes (Judiciary, 2022).

**Logic**: Transcripts are the *only objective, complete record* of what is said in court. All transparency depends on them.

## 4. Transcripts: The Achilles’ Heel

| Symptom | Transparency Fix | Transcript Role |
|---------|------------------|-----------------|
| Delays (36–41 weeks) | Scrutiny → efficiency | Templates from past cases (NAO, 2025) |
| Unmet 26-week limit | Exposes bottlenecks | Data for reform (Children and Families Act, 2014) |
| ~47k unresolved cases | Workload monitoring | Precedents speed disposal |
| 90% domestic abuse | Open proceedings | Irrefutable evidence (Bureau, 2025) |
| Pro-contact bias | Pattern scrutiny | Exposes flawed reasoning |
| Advice deserts | Public case info | Free anonymised database |
| Transcript inaccessibility | Admin oversight | Routine publication |

## 5. The Data Void: FOI Evidence

J. Walker’s FOI request (20 May 2025) to the MoJ sought transcript statistics (Apr 2024–Apr 2025). Response: **partial denial** — Section 12(2) cost exemption, "data not held" for Newcastle, incomplete operational data (Walker, 2025). This violates Section 16 (assistance duty) and TIG’s data goals.

## 6. Barriers to Transcript Access

### 6.1 Process
Forms EX105/EX107 require judicial approval. 10–15 day guideline routinely exceeded (Walker, 2025).

### 6.2 User Experience
> “£1,200 for one day. Appeal collapsed.” — Parent, X (2025)

### 6.3 Procurement
£20m framework (2023) with 8 suppliers — no SLAs for speed or open data (MoJ, 2023).

## 7. Policy Implications

Transcripts are **pivotal**, not ancillary. NatCen (2025) and TIG data sub-group emphasise their role in scrutiny. AI transcription (99.5% accuracy) could revolutionise access (MoJ, 2025c). Repealing parental presumption is progress — but **without transcripts, bias persists unchecked**.

## 8. Low-Resistance Interventions

| Area | Action | Owner |
|------|--------|-------|
| Data | Quarterly anonymised metrics | TIG Data Sub-Group |
| Procedure | Auto-approve; AI pilot | HMCTS |
| User Support | Free for vulnerable; public database | MoJ |
| Contracts | Delay penalties; open-data clauses | MoJ Procurement |

## 9. Conclusion: A Call to Action

The family justice crisis demands **evidence-driven reform**. Transcripts are its foundation.

**Policymakers**: Mandate transcript metrics in TIG reports.  
**Judiciary**: Pilot AI transcription in 3 courts by Q2 2026.  
**Public**: Write to transparency@judiciary.uk with this report.

**We don’t need a revolution. We need a transcript.**
