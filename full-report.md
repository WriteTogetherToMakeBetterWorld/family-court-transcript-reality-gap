# Unlocking Family Justice: Transcripts as the Keystone for Transparency, Accountability, and Reform

## 1. Introduction: The Deepening Crisis in Family Justice

The family justice system in England and Wales is mired in a crisis of delays, backlogs, and systemic failures that inflict lasting harm on children and families. As detailed in the National Audit Office (NAO) report of May 2025, nearly 50,000 family cases remained unresolved by December 2024, comprising 10,121 public law applications (local authority-initiated child protection cases) and 37,541 private law disputes (parental conflicts over child arrangements like residence or contact) (NAO, 2025). Updated figures from the Ministry of Justice's Family Court Statistics Quarterly for July to September 2025 indicate persistent pressures, with 65,709 new cases started in the prior quarter (April to June 2025) and a slight 4% reduction in open private law cases to 16,061 by September's end (MoJ, 2025a). Over 4,000 children continue to wait more than two years for substantive hearings, far exceeding the statutory 26-week limit for care proceedings under the Children and Families Act 2014—a benchmark unmet since its enactment over a decade ago (Children and Families Act, 2014, s 14(2); MoJ, 2025a).

Domestic abuse permeates 90% of private law cases, yet a entrenched "pro-contact culture" often prioritises parental involvement over child safety, leading to mishandled allegations and ongoing risks (Bureau of Investigative Journalism, 2025; Transparency Project, 2023a). Access barriers compound the issue: "advice deserts" in underserved areas deprive many of legal support, while digital exclusion impacts 33% of the population, barring effective engagement with online systems (Byrom, 2024). Appeals frequently collapse due to transcripts—verbatim records essential for verifying proceedings—being delayed, costly, or unavailable (Walker, 2025; Transparency Project, 2021).

This is not just inefficiency; it is systemic re-traumatisation. Prolonged uncertainty exacerbates emotional harm, with the annual cost of family justice escalating to £1.8 billion and legal aid per case doubling to £12,000 (NAO, 2025). As the Byline Times reported in May 2025, thousands of children endure years in limbo amid rising costs and fragmented oversight (Hencke, 2025). The House of Commons Public Accounts Committee (PAC) in September 2025 lambasted the government's "lack of urgency," highlighting regional disparities where cases resolve in 18 weeks in Wales but 70 weeks in London, driven by shortages of district judges and social workers (House of Commons Public Accounts Committee, 2025).

## 2. Reforms Amid Persistent Hurdles: Signs of Progress and Gaps

Reform efforts offer glimmers of hope. The Family Court’s Annual Report for October 2023 to September 2024 acknowledges the "substantial backlog" but spotlights initiatives like the relaunched Public Law Outline (PLO), designed to enforce pre-proceedings management and the 26-week timeline (Judiciary, 2024). The Pathfinder pilot, emphasising child-centred approaches via early Child Impact Reports from CAFCASS or Cafcass Cymru, is now live in North Wales, South East Wales, Dorset, and Birmingham, with backlogs of legacy cases nearly cleared and average durations reduced by 11 weeks (Judiciary, 2024).

In his April 2025 "View from The President’s Chambers," Sir Andrew McFarlane, President of the Family Division, commended PLO progress: 37% of public law cases concluded within 26 weeks in late 2024, the highest pre-pandemic figure, with a 4% drop in outstanding cases (McFarlane, 2025). Yet London persists with chronic backlogs due to resource deficits and cultural resistance, prompting a Local Practice Note (McFarlane, 2025). The PAC's September 2025 report underscores these hurdles, criticising insufficient judges, social workers, and funding (House of Commons Public Accounts Committee, 2025). In response, the government announced in October 2025 plans to repeal the presumption of parental involvement in the Children Act 1989 to better protect children from abusive parents—a direct address to pro-contact biases (MoJ, 2025b).

## 3. Transparency as a Catalyst: Evolution and Implementation

Transparency stands as a transformative policy tool to rebuild trust and spur reform. It gained traction with Sir Andrew McFarlane's 2021 Transparency Review, aiming to reconcile privacy with accountability in opaque family courts (McFarlane, 2021). The **Transparency Implementation Group (TIG)**, formed in December 2021, advances this through five sub-groups: press attendance and reporting (pilot), data collection, media engagement, judgment anonymisation/publication, and financial remedies transparency (Judiciary, 2022). TIG's October 2022 report stresses building media-court trust for reliable, anonymised reporting to boost public confidence (Judiciary, 2022).

Practically, accredited journalists and legal bloggers can now attend and report on private proceedings under restrictions, following a pilot starting November 2022 in three courts (Judiciary, 2022). By January 27, 2025, this expanded nationwide and became permanent, with extensions to February 2025 in some areas (Judiciary, 2025a). The Transparency & Open Justice Board's Key Objectives affirm open justice as default, promoting access to listings, documents, and hearings (Judiciary, undated). The Justice Committee's 2022 report advocates enhanced media access and transcripts to sustain democratic oversight amid declining reporting (House of Commons Justice Committee, 2022). The MoJ's January 2025 Call for Evidence summary echoes this, urging better data and document access for trust-building (MoJ, 2025c).

Expert views reinforce transparency's potential: NatCen's 2025 evaluation of the pilot highlights improved public understanding without compromising privacy (NatCen, 2025). Legal commentators note it exposes biases, accelerates resolutions, and prevents harm via scrutiny (Transparency Project, 2023b). However, TIG (2022) and the Justice Committee (2023) identify a "data void" as a barrier, making family courts the UK's least visible jurisdiction. Challenges include inconsistent data, FOI barriers, and resistance, stalling full impact (House of Commons Justice Committee, 2023).

**Transcripts are the logical bedrock of each TIG sub-group**:

- **Press reporting**: Transcripts provide verbatim records, enabling accurate, anonymised journalism without reliance on notes (Transparency Project, 2021).
- **Data collection**: Transcripts are the only source for reliable metrics on delays, abuse prevalence, and outcomes (Transparency Project, 2022).
- **Media engagement**: Transcripts allow safe, redacted sharing with the public (House of Commons Justice Committee, 2022).
- **Judgment publication**: Transcripts ensure published rulings reflect actual proceedings (Judiciary, undated).
- **Financial remedies**: Transcripts document verbal agreements, preventing disputes (Judiciary, 2022).

Without transcripts, all sub-groups lack the **objective, complete record** necessary for transparency.

## 4. Transcripts: The Achilles' Heel and Foundation of Transparency

This article argues that transparency's efficacy depends on transcripts as its evidentiary bedrock. Without routine, accurate, accessible verbatim records, initiatives like media reporting and data publication falter. Transcripts enable reusable precedents, abuse evidence verification, and metrics—addressing the crisis logically: delays via efficiency, biases via scrutiny, inaccessibility via resources.

| Symptom of the Crisis | How Increased Transparency Addresses It | How Transcripts Help Address It |
|---------------|-----------------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Chronic delays (public law 36–41 weeks; >4,000 children >2 years) | Scrutinises processes for efficiency reforms (NAO, 2025). | Templates reduce reinvention (NAO, 2025). |
| Unmet 26-week limit since 2014 | Exposes flaws for enforcement (Children and Families Act 2014, s 14(2); NAO, 2025). | Highlights bottlenecks for reforms (Children and Families Act 2014, s 14(2); NAO, 2025). |
| Unresolved cases (~47,662) | Monitors workloads for allocation (NAO, 2025). | Precedents clear backlogs (NAO, 2025). |
| Domestic abuse mishandling (90% private cases) | Reveals issues via open proceedings (Bureau of Investigative Journalism, 2025). | Irrefutable testimony evidence (Bureau of Investigative Journalism, 2025). |
| Pro-contact culture | Scrutinises patterns for bias shifts (Bureau of Investigative Journalism, 2025). | Exposes decisions for reform (Bureau of Investigative Journalism, 2025). |
| Advice deserts/access barriers | Empowers self-represented with info (Byrom, 2024). | Free resources for preparation (Byrom, 2024). |
| Digital exclusion (33%) | Non-digital reporting access (Byrom, 2024). | Low-tech summaries as precedents (Byrom, 2024). |
| Transcript inaccessibility | Oversees admin for efficiency (Walker, 2025). | Routine/free access (Walker, 2025). |
| Data void/lack of accountability | Mandates metrics (Walker, 2025). | Data sources for metrics (Walker, 2025). |
| Financial inefficiency (£1.8bn) | Identifies cost drivers (NAO, 2025). | Template reuse cuts costs (NAO, 2025). |
| Re-traumatisation | Swift resolutions prioritised (Warners Solicitors, 2024). | Accurate documentation for outcomes (Warners Solicitors, 2024). |
| Public trust erosion | Visible decisions for oversight (McFarlane, 2025). | Verifiable evidence for corrections (McFarlane, 2025). |

## 5. The Data Void Exposed: Lessons from an FOI Request

J. Walker's May 20, 2025, FOI request to the MoJ illuminates the transcript data blackout. Seeking aggregates (requests, funding, times, denials, issues) for April 2024–2025, it targeted existing data. By October 26, 2025, processed with internal review, it yielded partial responses: Section 12(2) cost exemption for national stats (£600 limit), data "not held" for Newcastle specifics due to no "legal or business requirement," and incomplete operational details. The review upheld these, breaching Section 16 assistance duty. This opacity contravenes TIG's data goals and Justice Committee recommendations, demanding mandatory metrics for baseline accountability (Walker, 2025; House of Commons Justice Committee, 2022).

## 6. Analysing Barriers: Processes, Experiences, and Procurement

To identify low-resistance mechanisms for boosting transcript production/publication, this analysis draws on documents, user anecdotes, and procurement.

### 6.1 Documentary Analysis: Forms and Procedures

Requests use Forms EX105/EX107, requiring judicial approval for non-public funding. Guidelines stipulate 10-15 working days, but exceedances arise from recordings or backlogs. Lack of enforcement fosters inconsistencies (Walker, 2025).

### 6.2 Anecdotal Evidence: User Experiences on X

X reveals stark divergences: Costs reach $1,000s for transcripts, psychologists, or guardians, deterring appeals. Survivors note expense hinders appeals of erroneous decisions; ready transcripts would ease this. Calls for routine transcripts/records to litigants underscore data needs. These align with 2025 IT failure reports.

### 6.3 Procurement and Providers: Contracts and Terms

MoJ's £20m 2023 framework with eight suppliers (e.g., Auscript, Opus 2) prioritises cost over speed, lacking delay penalties or transparency clauses. A July 2025 tender and August session signal updates. AI trials aim for 99.5% accuracy to rival humans, potentially revolutionising access.

## 7. Policy Implications: Transcripts as Drivers of Systemic Change

Transcripts aren't ancillary; they're pivotal. Experts like those in NatCen's evaluation argue they underpin scrutiny, with TIG's data sub-group advancing collection for outcomes (NatCen, 2025). AI integration could slash costs/delays, per MoJ explorations (MoJ, 2025c). Repealing parental presumptions signals responsiveness, but without transcript metrics, biases persist unchecked (MoJ, 2025b).

## 8. Low-Resistance Interventions: Actionable Pathways Forward

To catalyse change:

- **Data Collection:** TIG mandate quarterly anonymised metrics on requests/delays.
- **Procedures:** Automate approvals; pilot AI drafts for speed/accuracy.
- **User Support:** Free/low-cost for vulnerable; anonymised database for precedents.
- **Contracts:** Add SLAs, open-data clauses; accelerate AI rollout.

Key phrases: "Family courts reinvent the wheel—transcripts are the blueprint." "One transcript unveils more truth than 100 reporters." "No revolution needed—just transcripts." "Transparency ignites with the spoken word." "Transcribe to transform justice."

## 9. Conclusion: A Call to Action for Verifiable Justice

The family justice crisis demands bold, evidence-driven reform. Transparency, evolved since 2021, holds promise, but transcripts are its foundation. By implementing these interventions, we can reduce delays, expose harms, and restore trust—safeguarding children. Policymakers: Prioritise transcript reforms in TIG agendas. Stakeholders: Advocate via petitions to MoJ or MPs. Join the push—contact transparency@judiciary.uk or support NatCen evaluations. Together, unlock justice for a better world.
