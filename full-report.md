# Abstract

The family justice system in England and Wales is in systemic crisis. Over 50,000 cases remain unresolved, 4,000 children await decisions for more than two years, and domestic abuse features in 90% of private law proceedings — yet is frequently minimised or ignored (National Audit Office, 2025; Hencke, 2025; Bureau of Investigative Journalism, 2025). This article contends that these symptoms — chronic delay, fragmented governance, entrenched “pro-contact” bias, and profound human harm — are not intractable. They can be addressed through **transparency**, with **court transcripts** as its indispensable foundation.

Drawing on official reports, Ministry of Justice statistics, Freedom of Information data on transcript processing, and stakeholder testimony, this analysis advances a **least-resistance reform hypothesis**:  
> **Transparency is the invisible force capable of resolving multiple crises simultaneously, and transcripts are its operational bedrock.**

The article proceeds in four stages: (1) logical mapping of crisis symptoms to transparency deficits; (2) critical viability testing of transcript improvement as a low-cost, high-impact intervention; (3) practice-based assessment of current transcription access, approval, and publication barriers; and (4) synthesis of gaps followed by **pragmatic, incremental solutions** — e.g., **form updates**, **court-to-transcriber timeline clarity**, and **provisional transcript release upon transcription, with simultaneous judicial and party review during the appeal window**.

These **least-resistance reforms** leverage existing infrastructure (TIG pilots, TOJ principles) to close the “reality gap” between courtroom dialogue and recorded outcome. Transcripts do not merely document — they **verify truth, accelerate resolutions, expose bias, and restore trust**. This is not a call for revolution. It is a call for a transcript.

## 1. The Crises: Symptoms of Systemic Failure

### 1.1. The Crisis of Timeliness: Chronic Backlogs and Delays

The principle that justice delayed is justice denied is acutely relevant in family law, where protracted uncertainty inflicts substantial harm on children and parents. The family court system is currently failing to deliver timely justice, with case backlogs reaching critical levels.

The scale of the problem is stark. A recent report from the National Audit Office (NAO) revealed nearly 50,000 unresolved family court cases, with the most severe instances seeing around 4,000 children waiting over two years for critical decisions about their future (NAO, 2025). This systemic delay is not a recent phenomenon. According to Warners Solicitors (2024), private children law cases—those determining where children live and who they have contact with—were taking an average of 47 weeks to conclude in 2024, up from 45 weeks between July and September 2023 and continuing an upward trend seen over the last seven years.

The human impact of these statistics is immense. Law Society president Nick Emmerson highlighted that over 80,000 children were caught in these family backlogs, living in a state of prolonged instability (The Law Society, 2023). Even statutory targets are being missed; the 26-week time limit for resolving most public law cases, introduced in 2014 to bring swiftness to proceedings involving child protection, has not been met since its inception. Recent data from the President's Chambers View (April 2025) shows partial progress through the **Public Law Outline (PLO) relaunch** — a judicial initiative to reimpose the 26-week target across all care cases — with 37% of public law cases concluded within 26 weeks in Q4 2024, the highest since pre-pandemic levels. However, regional disparities persist (e.g., 70 weeks in London vs. 18 weeks in Wales), and the system remains far from the statutory benchmark.

### 1.2. Fragmented Governance and Weak Accountability

A core driver of this inefficiency is a fractured and incoherent governance structure. Responsibility for the family justice system is dispersed across multiple government bodies, with **no single organisation accountable for overall performance**:

- **The Ministry of Justice (MoJ)**: Responsible for private family law policy.
- **The Department for Education (DfE)**: Responsible for public family law policy.
- **HM Courts and Tribunals Service (HMCTS)**: Responsible for the administration of the courts.
- **Cafcass (Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service)**: Represents children in family court cases.

This dispersal leads to fragmented decision-making and weak accountability. The ministerial-led **Family Justice Board (FJB)**, established to foster effective collaboration, has been hampered by frequent turnover of its ministerial chairs and the absence of a cohesive, long-term strategy. At the local level, **Local Family Justice Boards (LFJBs)** — non-statutory bodies intended to drive improvement by bringing together local practitioners — **lack dedicated resources and formal powers**. They **do not publish findings**, **do not report to Parliament**, and have **no enforcement mechanism**. They **share local insights informally with stakeholders** but **cannot mandate change or enforce standards**, resulting in highly variable effectiveness and limited oversight, contributing to inconsistencies in performance across different regions.

### 1.3. The Data Deficit: A Barrier to Evidence-Based Policy

The ability to diagnose problems and design effective solutions is severely hampered by a systemic data deficit. Significant gaps in data collection prevent a full understanding of the system's performance, its costs, and its impact on users.

According to the NAO, it is not yet possible to track a child’s journey through the entire family justice process, making it difficult to identify bottlenecks or measure end-to-end outcomes (NAO, 2025). There are also critical weaknesses in data collection that limit systemic insight — for example, the absence of comprehensive tracking of case progression, resource allocation, or long-term outcomes for families.

These high-level systemic failures of timeliness, governance, and data create a dysfunctional environment that critically undermines the court’s ability to deliver just, timely, and verifiable outcomes — the very foundation of family stability.

## 2. Transparency Framework and Evolution: From Principle to Implementation

Reform efforts offer glimmers of hope. The Family Court’s Annual Report for October 2023 to September 2024 acknowledges the "substantial backlog" but spotlights initiatives like the relaunched Public Law Outline (PLO), designed to enforce pre-proceedings management and the 26-week timeline (Judiciary, 2024). The Pathfinder pilot, emphasising child-centred approaches via early Child Impact Reports from CAFCASS or Cafcass Cymru, is now live in North Wales, South East Wales, Dorset, and Birmingham, with backlogs of legacy cases nearly cleared and average durations reduced by 11 weeks (Judiciary, 2024).

In his April 2025 "View from The President’s Chambers," Sir Andrew McFarlane, President of the Family Division, commended PLO progress: 37% of public law cases concluded within 26 weeks in late 2024, the highest pre-pandemic figure, with a 4% drop in outstanding cases (McFarlane, 2025). Yet London persists with chronic backlogs due to resource deficits and cultural resistance, prompting a Local Practice Note (McFarlane, 2025). The PAC's September 2025 report underscores these hurdles, criticising insufficient judges, social workers, and funding (House of Commons Public Accounts Committee, 2025). In response, the government announced in October 2025 plans to repeal the presumption of parental involvement in the Children Act 1989 to better protect children from abusive parents—a direct address to pro-contact biases (MoJ, 2025b).

**These reforms — PLO, Pathfinder, repeal of presumption — are powerful in isolation. But they operate in silos. The critical question is not *what* they fix, but *how* they can be unified under one principle.** The answer is **transparency** — the invisible force that turns isolated fixes into systemic change. This article's hypothesis holds that transparency, with transcripts as its bedrock, is the missing link.

## 3. Transparency as a Catalyst: Evolution and Implementation

The transparency agenda did not emerge in isolation. It gained momentum with **Sir Andrew McFarlane's 2021 Transparency Review** ("Confidence and Confidentiality"), initiated in 2019 to balance child privacy with public trust in family justice amid growing criticism of opacity (McFarlane, 2021). McFarlane, as President of the Family Division, led the review panel, concluding that the "veil of secrecy" fueled mistrust and recommending greater media access and judgment publication.

Thanks to this review, the **Transparency Implementation Group (TIG)** was formed in December 2021, comprising over 30 members from judiciary, legal, and media sectors (Judiciary, 2022). TIG's work is not a side thought but **increasingly the guiding light for family court reform**, as evidenced by its integration into core policy. However, it is not yet fully positioned as the comprehensive solution to crises — a gap this article addresses by arguing transparency's "invisible force" potential.

Practically, TIG's sub-groups drive implementation: press reporting pilots (launched November 2022 in three courts, expanded nationwide by 2025), data collection, media engagement, judgment anonymisation, and financial remedies transparency (Judiciary, 2022). Accredited journalists and legal bloggers can now attend and report on private proceedings under anonymity rules, fostering trust (Judiciary, 2025a). The **Transparency & Open Justice Board (TOJ)** affirms open justice as the default, promoting access to case info, documents, and hearings (Judiciary, undated).

Expert views reinforce transparency's catalytic role: NatCen's 2025 pilot evaluation shows improved public understanding without privacy breaches (NatCen, 2025). The Justice Committee (2022) advocates enhanced media access and transcripts for democratic oversight. The MoJ's 2025 Call for Evidence urges better data and document sharing (MoJ, 2025c). **FOI (Freedom of Information)** requests reveal ongoing barriers, like transcript denials due to recording issues (Walker, 2025).

Challenges persist: inconsistent data, resistance, and a "data void" (House of Commons Justice Committee, 2023). Yet, transparency is evolving from peripheral to central philosophy, **with this article proposing it as the unifying force directly responding to the symptoms of crises** — though not yet fully harnessed in current policy frameworks.
Even within the current system, those who already request and fund transcripts could — with minimal procedural change — become the system’s most powerful transparency engine (see Section 6 → 7).


## 4. Logical Mapping: From Crises to Transparency Deficits

Before mapping transparency deficits, it helps to clarify how the argument is structured.  
**First**, this section explains *why* the family-court crises are rooted in opacity and how transcripts provide the visibility needed to repair them (macro level).  
**Second**, it shows *where* transparency operates inside the court system — through its governing structures, procedural rules, and initiatives such as the Transparency Implementation Group (TIG) and the Transparency & Open Justice (TOJ) Board (institutional level).  
**Third**, it prepares for *how* this theory will be tested in later sections, using evidence from court users, procedural forms, and transcript-processing data (methodological level).  
Together, these steps build a logical bridge from theory to practice: from understanding why transparency matters, to seeing where it fits, to testing whether it actually works.

---

### 4.1 Macro Logic: Mapping Transparency Deficits to Transcript Solutions

The working assumption of this article is that the multiple crises of the family-justice system — delay, fragmentation, bias, and harm — are not merely accompanied by transparency deficits; they are driven by them. Each symptom of dysfunction is mirrored by an information failure: delayed judgments by missing transcripts, inconsistent practice by opaque governance, and inequitable outcomes by the absence of verifiable records.

This analysis therefore treats transparency not as a peripheral reform but as the mechanism through which the other crises can be resolved. Transcripts provide the verbatim, objective record of proceedings — the raw material for scrutiny, data, and reform. Without them, transparency is superficial: summaries can distort, notes can omit, and judgments can diverge from what was said.  
The mapping below tests the hypothesis that each crisis symptom links to a transparency deficit and that transcripts resolve both.

| **Crisis Symptom** | **Transparency Deficit** | **Transcript Mechanism of Resolution** | **Evidence** |
|---------------------|---------------------------|----------------------------------------|---------------|
| Chronic delay and backlog | No real-time visibility into hearings; orders depend on recollection; appeal preparation stalls. | Provisional release of transcripts enables immediate review and correction, shortening appeal cycles. | Warners Solicitors (2024); Walker FOI (2025) |
| Fragmented governance and weak accountability | Agencies (MoJ, DfE, HMCTS, Cafcass) operate on inconsistent data. | Centralised transcript repository provides shared evidential record for oversight. | TIG Progress Report (2022) |
| Data deficit and absence of systemic learning | Outcomes cannot be linked to process data; policy based on anecdote. | Machine-readable transcript metadata allows longitudinal, evidence-based policy. | NAO (2025); TIG Data Sub-group (2022) |
| Pro-contact bias and minimisation of abuse | No verifiable record of testimony; survivor voice reduced in judgments. | Verbatim transcripts reveal judicial framing, enabling bias scrutiny and PD 12J / Article 6 ECHR compliance. | Bureau of Investigative Journalism (2025) |
| Erosion of public trust and perceived secrecy | Hearings private; judgments seldom published. | Redacted transcript publication operationalises TOJ principles. | House of Commons Justice Committee (2022) |
| Human harm (re-traumatisation, instability) | Lack of verifiable outcomes and feedback loop. | Accurate records reduce re-hearings and rebuild confidence. | FLAG DV (2024); Byline Times (2025) |

**Conclusion of Mapping**

Every crisis symptom is a transparency deficit. Every transparency deficit is a transcript deficit.  
In this model, transcripts act as the connective tissue between transparency and reform.  
They turn process into data, dialogue into evidence, and judgment into verifiable record — a low-cost intervention with high systemic leverage.

---

### 4.2 Institutional Logic: Embedding Transparency in Governance

Having established why transcripts matter conceptually, the next question is *where* this remedy can be operationalised.  
The answer lies within the **Transparency Implementation Group (TIG)** — the body created by the President of the Family Division to translate transparency principles into day-to-day judicial practice.  
Each of TIG’s five sub-groups depends on transcripts not as an accessory but as an operational necessity.

| **TIG Sub-Group** | **Transparency Goal** | **Transcript Role** | **Source** |
|--------------------|-----------------------|---------------------|-------------|
| Press reporting | Enable accurate, anonymised journalism. | Verbatim records prevent misreporting and misquotation. | Transparency Project (2021) |
| Data collection | Create reliable metrics on delay and abuse. | Transcripts are the only objective source of process data. | TIG Data Sub-group (2022) |
| Media engagement | Facilitate safe public communication. | Redacted transcripts provide controlled openness. | Justice Committee (2022) |
| Judgment publication | Ensure published rulings reflect reality. | Transcripts verify that written judgments match oral findings. | Judiciary (undated) |
| Financial remedies | Prevent post-hearing disputes. | Captures verbal agreements and reasoning accurately. | Judiciary (2022) |

Without transcripts, the TIG architecture cannot function as designed.

The institutional logic therefore confirms the macro-hypothesis: transparency depends on transcription.  
Where transcripts are missing or delayed, TIG’s goals — accurate reporting, data integrity, and public accountability — become structurally impossible to deliver.

### 4.3 Empirical Validation: The Reality Gap

The mapping and institutional framework show what *should* work; empirical evidence shows why it still does not.  
Freedom-of-Information disclosures and Ministry of Justice statements reveal a persistent **reality gap** — the disconnect between what is said in court and what is recorded, shared, or used.

| **Gap** | **Evidence** |
|----------|---------------|
| Transcript inaccessibility | FOI responses citing “recording issues” as grounds for denial (Walker 2025). |
| No national data | MoJ confirms absence of a central transcript-tracking system (Walker 2025). |
| Appeal delays | Provisional release blocked pending judicial approval, compounding procedural backlog. |

This reality gap empirically tests the article’s central hypothesis:  
if transcripts remain inaccessible, transparency cannot resolve crises.  
The existence of these deficits underscores both the urgency and the feasibility of least-resistance reforms — procedural adjustments that make transparency operational rather than aspirational.  

The next section develops this methodological logic by analysing anecdotal user evidence, court-form structures, and transcript-processing data to identify precisely where and how these breakdowns occur.

### 4.4 Beyond the Present Logic: Larger Paradigms and Least-Resistance Change

While this article focuses on practical reforms achievable within the current rules and infrastructure, it is important to recognise that more transformative paradigms of transparency are possible.  
These approaches imagine deeper cultural and structural shifts in how justice itself is conceived — shifts that challenge not only practice but the underlying logic of how courts define truth, ownership, and participation.

#### Alternative Paradigms of Transparency

1. **From Permission to Presumption**  
   - *Current logic:* Secrecy by default — transcripts and publication require judicial permission.  
   - *Alternative:* Openness by default — transcripts automatically created and anonymised unless there are compelling reasons to restrict them.  
   - *Shift:* From *“transparency if justified”* to *“secrecy if justified.”*  
   - *Example:* The Transparency Reporting Pilot’s expansion (now standard via Practice Directions PD12R and PD14G as of January 2025) allows accredited journalists to report on hearings unless restricted, signalling a systemic move toward openness across all tiers, as noted in the TIG Progress Report and the President’s April 2025 View.

2. **From Private Ownership to Shared Record**  
   - *Current logic:* Recordings belong to the court; access is a privilege.  
   - *Alternative:* Transcripts treated as a **jointly owned civic record** or public knowledge asset, managed through neutral digital archives or “justice data trusts.”  
   - *Shift:* From *“court property”* to *“public resource.”*  
   - *Example:* The Transparency & Open Justice Board’s Key Objectives (2024) describe core documents — judgments, evidence, and transcripts — as a public resource, with TIG’s anonym

## 5. Empirical Testing: The Data Void Exposed

Having built the logic that transparency depends on transcripts (§4.1), located that logic within the court system’s structures (§4.2), and revealed the empirical “reality gap” of missing transcription metrics (§4.3), we now move to the first stage of practical testing.  
This section examines what the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) and associated court services actually hold in terms of transcript data — their availability, processing, refusal rates, and bottlenecks. The analysis is based on a Freedom of Information (FOI) request submitted by **J. Walker on 20 May 2025**, which sought aggregate statistics on transcript requests, funding types, processing times, denials, and technical issues for the period **April 2024–April 2025**.

### 5.1 Findings: The FOI Data Void

By **26 October 2025**, after initial processing and an internal review, the MoJ’s response was **partial and restrictive**:

- **National statistics** were withheld under *Section 12(2)* of the FOI Act 2000, citing the £600 cost-exemption limit.  
- For **Newcastle Civil and Family Court and Tribunals Centre**, data was reported as *“not held”* because there was *“no legal or business requirement”* to record it.  
- Operational details were incomplete: breakdowns by funding type (public/private) were provided, but there were no comprehensive metrics on denials, delays, or technical recording issues.  
- The internal review upheld these decisions, breaching *Section 16’s duty to assist* by failing to advise how the request could be refined (Walker, 2025).  

This outcome exposes a **systemic transparency gap**: the absence of even basic statistical oversight over transcript processing. It directly contravenes the **Transparency Implementation Group (TIG)** data sub-group’s objectives and the **Justice Committee’s** 2022 recommendation that baseline metrics be collected and published for accountability (TIG Progress Report, 2022; House of Commons Justice Committee, 2022).

### 5.2 Defining Transcripts in Family Law Proceedings

Before analysing further, clarity is needed on what *“transcripts”* mean in this context.  
In family proceedings, transcripts are **verbatim records of oral hearings** — the word-for-word account of what is said in court, including:

- Oral arguments by parties or counsel  
- Witness testimony and evidential exchanges  
- Judicial questions, comments, and oral judgments (where not issued in writing)  
- Oral orders or directions delivered in hearings  

They **do not** include written submissions such as *skeleton arguments* or *position statements* — documents prepared in advance, not spoken verbatim.  
However, as the **Justice Committee (2022)** and **Transparency & Open Justice Board (TOJ)** note, publishing such written materials alongside transcripts could, in future, provide valuable procedural context.  

For this article, the focus remains on **oral transcripts** because they capture the *dynamic and unfiltered reality of courtroom dialogue* — the precise arena where discrepancies between speech and record create the “reality gap.”

### 5.3 Implications: The Absence of Foundational Data

### 5.3 Implications: The Absence of Foundational Data

The FOI’s revelation of a **data void** exposes a fundamental contradiction in current policy:  
transparency reforms cannot succeed without basic, measurable data on the very instrument that enables transparency — the transcript itself.

This absence of transcript-related metrics perpetuates multiple systemic crises:

- **Delay**, through untracked transcription backlogs and approval bottlenecks;  
- **Bias**, through the lack of data on how survivor testimony or judicial reasoning is captured and represented;  
- **Fragmentation**, as no inter-agency dataset exists for monitoring performance, appeals, or cross-system outcomes.  

Addressing this deficiency requires **mandatory reporting** on transcript requests, completions, delays, and denials — a *least-resistance* reform fully aligned with the Transparency Implementation Group (TIG) data-collection goals.  

In short, the **data void** is both an obstacle and a diagnostic tool.  
By revealing what is missing, it identifies the precise structural levers through which transparency can move from aspiration to implementation.  

Yet the absence of even minimal transcript metrics renders traditional quantitative evaluation impossible.  
Consequently, the next stage adopts an **alternative empirical strategy** — analysing *publicly available user narratives* as a proxy dataset.  
These accounts, systematically collected and coded, expose the micro-failures that aggregate into the systemic opacity documented here.  

The following analysis therefore extends this empirical lens through two interlinked pathways of transparency:  
1. how transcripts are **obtained**, and  
2. how they are **published**.  
Section 6 begins with the former; Section 6.2 examines the latter.

## 6. Practice Analysis: Two Pathways of Transparency — Obtaining and Publishing Transcripts

The preceding sections established why transcripts are the bedrock of transparency and how the system currently fails to monitor them.

This section begins a practice-based examination of **two interdependent transparency pathways**:
1. **The Obtaining Pathway** — how transcripts are requested, produced, and approved; and
2. **The Publication Pathway** — how transcripts are anonymised, shared, and used to enable accountability and learning.

These two processes are conceptually distinct but functionally inseparable.

**If reform stops at improving how transcripts are obtained, without enabling their publication, transparency remains private.**

Knowledge of judicial reasoning, error, and bias would stay confined to the individual family, never transferring into institutional learning or precedent-based improvement.

Thus, the *linkage* between obtaining and publishing is itself the critical reform step — the point where personal justice becomes systemic justice.

This chapter operationalises the central hypothesis by examining how transcripts are actually obtained and, where possible, made public in the family courts of England and Wales.

It returns to the article’s fundamental conceptual framing: **how can change be achieved with the least resistance yet the greatest systemic impact?**

To answer this, the analysis integrates **two complementary evidence streams**:
- **Documentary and procedural review** — official forms, Family Procedure Rules (FPR 2010, PD 5A, 12G, 12D), and Transparency Implementation Group (TIG) guidance, tracing what the system formally prescribes and how it functions administratively;
- **User-experience synthesis** — systematically analysed court-user narratives and practitioner commentary that reveal how these processes operate in practice, exposing procedural gaps, costs, delays, denials, and barriers to publication.

By combining these two streams, the analysis moves between the *institutional view* of how the process is supposed to work and the *experiential view* of how it actually unfolds.

This dual perspective allows us to locate both procedural choke points and structural disconnections — the practical places where transparency either succeeds or collapses.

### 6.1.1 Search Strategy for Anecdotal User Evidence

Because no national dataset exists on transcript accessibility (§5), this study incorporated systematically sourced anecdotal data from public legal forums to examine users’ lived experience of the transcript process.

The objective was to triangulate **procedural design** (what the system prescribes) with **experiential reality** (how users encounter it), identifying barriers, costs, and procedural choke points across both the *obtaining* and *publication* pathways.

#### Rationale for Anecdotal Data
1. **Pragmatic necessity.** There is no central or disaggregated database tracking transcript requests, delays, denials, or costs. The *data void* revealed in §5 makes anecdotal material the only available empirical entry point to examine how transparency functions in practice.
2. **Conceptual alignment.** The *least-resistance reform* hypothesis targets small, recurrent frictions. Aggregated user reports surface those micro-failures where policy intent meets real-world process.
3. **Transparency logic.** Using publicly available posts preserves openness and replicability: items are timestamped, visible, and auditable.

#### Data Sources (Anecdotal Corpus)
Searches targeted open platforms that host verifiable, timestamped user narratives and practitioner interactions:
- **JustAnswer.co.uk** — legally moderated Q&A reflecting real procedural encounters (N=12).
- **Mumsnet.com** — lived-experience accounts from litigants in person.
- **Reddit /r/LegalAdviceUK** — informal but detailed case descriptions, often with procedural specifics and costs.

> **Important scope note:** **WhatDoTheyKnow (WDTK)** hosts FOI correspondence and is **not** part of the anecdotal user corpus. FOI materials are treated as **documentary evidence** (see §5) and used here only for **triangulation** (below).

#### Search Framework and Logic
To ensure **replicability, breadth, and thematic saturation**, Google/DuckDuckGo were used with domain-restricted Boolean operators (`site:`). Queries were grouped under six hypothesised friction points:

| Theme | Analytical Purpose | Example Query Syntax |
|------|---------------------|----------------------|
| **Access & Procedure** | How users request transcripts / navigate forms | `site:justanswer.co.uk "family court" transcript` |
| **Cost & Funding** | Costs, invoices, Legal Aid barriers | `site:justanswer.co.uk transcript AND ("cost" OR "Legal Aid")` |
| **Delays & Denials** | Time, refusals, recording problems | `site:justanswer.co.uk transcript AND ("delay" OR "refused" OR "recording missing")` |
| **Procurement & Vendor Issues** | Quality/timing of approved transcribers | `site:justanswer.co.uk "transcription company" AND ("delay" OR "problem")` |
| **Publication & Anonymisation** | Experiences of sharing/making public | `site:justanswer.co.uk transcript AND ("publish" OR "anonymisation")` |
| **Comparative Transparency** | Context across justice settings | `site:justanswer.co.uk "open justice" AND "family court"` |

Search window: **1 Jan 2023 – 26 Oct 2025** (post-pandemic backlogs, TIG rollouts, current HMCTS procurement cycle).

#### Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria
- **Included:** England & Wales family-law posts referencing transcripts/recordings or named forms (e.g., EX107); with checkable procedural detail (venue/date/actor); describing at least one stage (*request → production → approval/publication*).
- **Excluded:** criminal/tribunal matters; press-only access disputes; unverifiable or jurisdiction-ambiguous content; duplicates; general complaints without procedural detail.

#### Data Treatment
Each item was logged (URL, platform, date/time) and anonymised.
Items were thematically coded (delay, cost, denial, vendor issue, publication barrier) and mapped to the two transparency pathways:
- **Obtaining Pathway:** request, cost/funding, vendor stage, judicial approval;
- **Publication Pathway:** anonymisation, authorisation, hosting/access.

No contact was made with authors or moderators. All quotations were anonymised to prevent re-identification.

#### Documentary Triangulation (Not Part of Anecdotal Corpus)
Consistent with §5, **FOI correspondence** (e.g., WDTK) and official notices (Judiciary/HMCTS) were used **only to corroborate** anecdotal claims (e.g., stated timelines, refusal grounds, procurement arrangements). These documents were analysed as **documentary evidence** in §5 and are not included in the anecdotal dataset reported in §6.

#### Validity and Replicability
This dual-source approach aligns with the article’s framework: transparency is procedural.
By combining open, replicable user accounts with documentary corroboration, the analysis reconstructs how transparency is **actually lived**, identifying precise points where least-resistance reforms can yield the largest systemic gains.

### 6.2 Documentary/Procedural Analysis (Rules, Forms, Guidance)

**Instruments analysed.** Family Procedure Rules 2010 (FPR), Practice Direction 5A (PD5A), transcript request forms/guidance (e.g., EX107 request, EX107GN guidance; EX105 where applicable), local practice notes where available, and judiciary/HMCTS notices relevant to recordings and approvals.

**Analytic focus.** We map text to practice for three discrete phases (below), capturing:
(i) mandatory steps, (ii) discretionary steps, (iii) documents exchanged, (iv) time expectations (stated vs. observed), and (v) failure points (with remedies, if any).

#### 6.2.1 Confidentiality Rules Governing Publication (AJA 1960 s.12; FPR 2010 rr.12.73–12.75; PD12G)

Family proceedings are presumptively private, and this privacy extends to any *account of what transpired* in court — including **transcripts**, **notes of evidence and submissions**, and **transcripts/notes of judgments**. Recent practice commentary highlights that the standard **confidentiality warning** commonly attached to Family Court orders has been updated to spell this out explicitly:

> *“Until the conclusion of the proceedings no person shall publish … any material which is intended or likely to identify the child[ren] … Further, during the proceedings or after they have concluded no person shall publish information related to the proceedings including accounts of what has gone on in front of the judge, documents filed in the proceedings, **transcripts or notes of evidence and submissions**, and **transcripts and notes of judgments** (including extracts, quotations, or summaries). Any person who does so may be in contempt of court.”*

The newer wording **does not change the law**; it clarifies it.

The legal bases include **Children Act 1989 s.97** (child identification) and **Administration of Justice Act 1960 s.12** (publication from private proceedings). “Publish” includes **social media**.

The **Family Procedure Rules 2010** create limited exceptions (e.g., rr.12.73, 12.75; PD12G) allowing sharing with legal advisers, experts, or where the **court gives permission**. Crucially, **possession of a lawfully obtained transcript via EX107 does not itself confer a right to publish**. Publication requires **permission and/or compliant anonymisation** within the framework above.

**Implication for this article’s model:** any pathway for transcript-based transparency must (i) build in anonymisation, and (ii) provide a **permission route** (standard wording/order templates), so the publication pathway is lawful rather than merely procedural.

### 6.3 The Three Phases in Practice (with measurable checkpoints)

| Phase | What must happen | Documents / Actors | Typical time claims | Common failure points | Practical, low-resistance fixes |
|-------|------------------|--------------------|---------------------|-----------------------|---------------------------------|
| A. Pre-Vendor (Court intake & permission) | Identify hearing/date; confirm audio exists; determine who may request; obtain permission if required. | Applicant; court listing; EX107 + fee; PD5A criteria; any anonymity directions. | Often quoted as 5–10 working days to authorise/forward to vendor. | Audio missing/corrupt; uncertainty over who may request; inconsistent permission practices; incomplete EX107. | Form redesign: tick-box for role (party/journalist/other) + hearing ID; auto-check audio existence before payment; template orders granting transcript for appeal prep. |
| B. Vendor Stage (Transcription company) | Court sends audio; vendor quotes; requester pays (or provides LAA authority); transcription produced. | HMCTS-approved vendor; quote/invoice; LAA reference if public funding. | Claims of 10–15 working days (varies). | Long queues; unclear start clock (when did vendor receive audio?); per-minute costs opaque; returns for “inaudible” segments. | Time-stamped handover notice (court→vendor); quote standardisation (show per-minute rate, estimated total, SLA); escalation path for corrupt audio. |
| C. Judicial Approval & Publication | Judge reviews transcript; corrections/anonymisation; release to parties; optional publication. | Judge; parties; anonymisation policy; any pilot (TIG/TOJ). | Variable; often open-ended; appeals stall. | Gatekeeping delays; no provisional access; uncertainty about publication/redaction rules. | Provisional release on completion (marked “subject to approval”) for appeal prep; standard redaction rules; target turnaround for approval (e.g., 5–7 working days). |

**Key observation.** Each phase currently contains opaque hand-offs (no shared clock, no “received” stamps) that make delay invisible and accountability diffuse.

### 6.4 Findings from the Anecdotal Dataset (concise synthesis)

**JustAnswer.co.uk (N=12)** — the only source with structured expert responses — reveals consistent barriers:

**Timelines by Stage** (medians, inferred):
- Pre-vendor: 14 days
- Vendor: 42 days
- Approval: 21 days
- **Total: 77 days** (claimed 25–35 days)

| Theme | Frequency | % |
|-------|-----------|-----|
| Delay drivers | 8 | 67% |
| Cost barrier | 7 | 58% |
| Gatekeeping/discretion | 9 | 75% |
| LIP inequity | 5 | 42% |
| Recording issues | 6 | 50% |
| Publication opacity | 4 | 33% |

- **Delays concentrate at hand-offs.** Users cannot tell when the clock starts.
- **Gatekeeping is inconsistent.** Similar requests receive different treatments (permission, redaction).
- **Costs deter LIPs.** £180+ invoices chill appeals; LAA routes unclear.
- **Recording integrity problems recur.** "Corrupt audio" a refusal ground.
- **Publication is exceptional.** Release limited to parties; public access rare.

**Anonymised Quotes**:
1. *"Filed EX107 3 months ago—paid £180, still nothing. LIP, can't afford chase."* (2024; delay, cost, LIP)
2. *"Audio 'corrupt'—court says no recording. How appeal?"* (2023; recording_missing, approval)
3. *"Transcriber quote £450 for 5 hours—LAA denied. Settled under pressure."* (2025; cost, settlement_pressure)

### 6.5 Limitations

- Self-selected posts skew negative; positives under-reported.
- Timings user-reported (triangulated where possible).
- N=12 limits generalisability, but saturation achieved on key themes.
- Analysis practice-facing, not substitute for national stats (whose absence is a major finding).

### 6.6 Immediate, Low-Resistance Process Improvements (derived from the above)

1. **EX107 form update**  
   Add: role tick-boxes; hearing ID helper; “check audio exists” banner; standard wording requesting provisional release on completion for appeal prep.

2. **Stamped hand-off receipts**  
   Automated time-stamps for court→vendor and vendor→court; both visible to requester.

3. **SLA visibility**  
   Publish target times (authorisation, production, approval) and show live status to parties.

4. **Standard redaction & approval window**  
   5–7 working-day judicial approval target; clear PD-conformant redaction checklist to reduce bounce-backs.

5. **Price transparency**  
   Standardised quotes (per-minute rate + estimated minutes + likely total); flag funding routes for LIPs.

### Enabling Public Access Through Existing Transcript Requests

The least resistant improvement to the current system is to build upon what already exists. Every year, parties, journalists, and researchers pay private vendors to obtain authorised transcripts of family court hearings under the EX107 process. These individuals have already navigated the procedural maze, obtained judicial approval, and financed transcription.

Allowing or encouraging these transcript holders to publish their authorised copies — either in anonymised form or via a central repository — represents the most efficient, system-compatible path to transparency. It does not require new infrastructure, legislative reform, or additional court resources. It simply extends the existing workflow of those who are already engaging with the transcript process.

In effect, it transforms an individual act of documentation into a collective act of public learning. The same transactions that currently produce siloed, inaccessible documents could instead generate a distributed corpus of verified, anonymised material — a real-time record of how family law is lived and adjudicated.

This model reframes *open justice* not as an abstract institutional reform but as an emergent by-product of ordinary procedural participation.

### 6.7 Conclusion

The JustAnswer dataset (N=12) confirms the **reality gap**: a median **77-day** transcript process, with **67%** of queries citing delays and **58%** cost barriers. Triangulated with Warners (47-week cases), Byline Times (50,000+ backlog), and FOI ("no data held"), it reveals **systemic opacity** — not malice, but **banal procedural friction**.

Anecdotes expose **LIP vulnerability**: users pay £180+ for records they cannot verify, while courts refuse raw audio. This undermines TIG goals (2022) and TOJ Objectives (2024).

**Least-resistance reform** — clearer forms, visible SLAs, provisional release — can be delivered **now**, within existing frameworks, while laying groundwork for **presumptive openness**.

## 7. Policy Implications: Transcripts as Drivers of Systemic Change

Transcripts aren't ancillary; they're pivotal. Experts like those in NatCen's evaluation argue they underpin scrutiny, with TIG's data sub-group advancing collection for outcomes (NatCen, 2025). AI integration could slash costs/delays, per MoJ explorations (MoJ, 2025c). Repealing parental presumptions signals responsiveness, but without transcript metrics, biases persist unchecked (MoJ, 2025b).

## 8. Low-Resistance Interventions: Actionable Pathways Forward

To catalyse change:

- **Data Collection:** TIG mandate quarterly anonymised metrics on requests/delays.
- **Procedures:** Automate approvals; pilot AI drafts for speed/accuracy.
- **User Support:** Free/low-cost for vulnerable; anonymised database for precedents.
- **Contracts:** Add SLAs, open-data clauses; accelerate AI rollout.

Key phrases: "Family courts reinvent the wheel—transcripts are the blueprint." "One transcript unveils more truth than 100 reporters." "No revolution needed—just transcripts." "Transparency ignites with the spoken word." "Transcribe to transform justice."

- Encourage voluntary publication of authorised transcripts already obtained under EX107 — a low-resistance path to transparency requiring no legislative reform.

## 9. Conclusion: A Call to Action for Verifiable Justice

The family justice crisis demands bold, evidence-driven reform. Transparency, evolved since 2021, holds promise, but transcripts are its foundation. By implementing these interventions, we can reduce delays, expose harms, and restore trust—safeguarding children. Policymakers: Prioritise transcript reforms in TIG agendas. Stakeholders: Advocate via petitions to MoJ or MPs. Join the push—contact transparency@judiciary.uk or support NatCen evaluations. Together, unlock justice for a better world.
