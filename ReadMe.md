# Family Court Reform

> *"One transcript = more truth than 100 reporters."*

- 50,000 unresolved family cases  
- 4,000 children waiting over 2 years for a decision  
- 90% of private law cases involve domestic abuse  

**Transcripts could change that.**  
They show what really happens in court. They prove truth and let the truth and what we believe "justice" is — justice prevails.

## The Method

1. **Live the problem** — court silence, puddles, farm mud  
2. **Capture chaos** — bad videos, raw notes  
3. **Connect pattern** — 5 layers of truth  
4. **Release living research** — open, evolving, citable
