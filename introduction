# 1. The Family Justice System in England and Wales: Backlog, Reform, and the Emerging Priority of Transparency

The family justice system in England and Wales continues to grapple with chronic delay and systemic overload. The National Audit Office (NAO) reports that, as of early 2025, **nearly 50,000 family cases remain unresolved**, comprising **10,121 public law applications** involving children at risk of care or adoption and **37,541 private law disputes** concerning child arrangements.[^1] Approximately **4,000 children have waited more than two years** for a substantive hearing, with average legal aid expenditure per public law case having **doubled from £6,000 to £12,000** between 2018 and 2022 — representing an annual cost escalation of £314 million.[^2] The statutory 26-week time limit for concluding care proceedings, introduced by the *Children and Families Act 2014*, **has not been met in any reporting year since its enactment** — a failure persisting for over a decade.[^3]

Amid this backdrop of sustained pressure, the **Family Court’s inaugural Annual Report** (October 2023–September 2024) offers a measured counter-narrative of incremental improvement.[^4] Public law applications **declined from 19,306 in 2018 to 15,552 in 2023**, while disposals **increased to 16,871** — the highest in six years.[^5] The report candidly acknowledges a “**substantial backlog**” but foregrounds structural interventions: the relaunched **Public Law Outline** to strengthen pre-proceedings case management, the **Pathfinder pilot** in private law (demonstrating an average reduction of 11 weeks in case duration in pilot courts), and the gradual stabilisation of digital systems, now described as “**starting to bed down**”.[^6] Additional reforms include targeted judicial training on domestic abuse and the default admission of Independent Domestic Violence Advisers to hearings.[^7]

Practitioner perspectives, however, underscore a persistent disjuncture between administrative metrics and experiential reality. **Warners Solicitors**, a firm with extensive frontline involvement in both public and private law proceedings, report:

> “Children are losing critical developmental windows, parents are exhausting financial and emotional reserves, and contact arrangements are collapsing — all in the absence of any predictable listing timeline.”[^8]

Within this landscape of **delay, reform, and lived harm**, **transparency has emerged as a central policy lever**. The Annual Report positions its own publication as a “**key step in the general move… towards greater transparency**”.[^9] Following the 2021 Transparency Review, the **Reporting Pilot** — allowing accredited journalists to attend and publish anonymised accounts of family proceedings — now operates in **approximately half of all Family Court areas**, with **full national rollout scheduled for early 2025**.[^10]

The section that follows examines **transparency not merely as procedural reform, but as a contested mechanism of accountability** — asking whether media access, in the absence of routine transcription
