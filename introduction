# 1. Introduction: The Crisis

## Skeleton (Structure & Logic)

1. **The Crisis in Numbers**  
   - Backlog, delay, cost (NAO 2025)  
   - Domestic abuse prevalence (TBIJ 2025)  
   - Advice deserts, digital exclusion (Nuffield 2024)  

2. **The Human Cost**  
   - Children waiting >2 years  
   - Appeals fail due to missing transcripts  
   - Systemic re-traumatisation  

3. **The Official Response**  
   - Family Court Annual Report (2024): reform, Pathfinder, digital  
   - Transparency Pilot → full rollout (Jan 2025)  

4. **The Logical Gap**  
   - Courts think transparency = press access  
   - But **transcripts are the real fix**  

5. **Transcripts as Bedrock**  
   - Verbatim records = templates, proof, prevention  
   - Without them = blackout  

6. **Thesis & Research Question**  
   - **Thesis**: Transcripts are the bedrock of transparency  
   - **Question**: How to boost them — *least resistance*?  

7. **Methodology Preview**  
   - Forms, user anecdotes, company T&Cs, FOI  

8. **Conclusion of Intro**  
   - The revolution is a transcript

## Publication-Ready Text

The family justice system in England and Wales is in profound crisis. As of May 2025, the National Audit Office (NAO) reports that **nearly 50,000 family cases remain unresolved**, including **10,121 public law applications** involving children at risk of care or adoption and **37,541 private law disputes** concerning child arrangements.[^1] New case starts reached **65,709 in April to June 2025** — up 2% on the previous year — with **over 4,000 children waiting more than two years** for a hearing.[^2] The statutory 26-week time limit for concluding care proceedings, introduced by the *Children and Families Act 2014*, **has not been met in any reporting year since its enactment**.[^3]

Domestic abuse features in **90% of private law cases**, yet courts routinely fail to recognise or act on it, placing children at risk through a pervasive pro-contact culture.[^4] Advice deserts and digital exclusion leave parents without support, with **33% of the population unable to engage online**.[^5] Appeals collapse because **transcripts — the only proof of what was said — are late, expensive, or missing**.[^6]

The **Family Court’s inaugural Annual Report** (2023–2024) acknowledges a “substantial backlog” but highlights reforms: the relaunched **Public Law Outline**, the **Pathfinder pilot** (reducing private law duration by 11 weeks), and digital systems “starting to bed down”.[^7] The **Reporting Pilot**, extended nationwide in January 2025, allows journalists to attend and publish anonymised accounts.[^8]

Yet a critical gap remains. Courts equate transparency with **press access** — but **transcripts are the bedrock**. Verbatim records become **templates** for faster rulings, **proof** against abuse denial, and **data** to prevent court entry.

This article asks:  
**If transcripts fix transparency, what are the easiest, least-resistant ways to boost their production and publication?**

We answer using:  
- Official forms and guidance  
- Real user experiences (JustAnswer, Transparency Project)  
- Transcription company contracts  
- FOI evidence of the data void  

The analysis proceeds from transparency's role in solving core problems to transcripts as its foundation, then to least-resistance boosts in data, forms, users, and companies.
