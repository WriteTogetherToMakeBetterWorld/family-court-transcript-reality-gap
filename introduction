## 1. Introduction: The Crisis

Family courts in England and Wales are **broken by delay, abuse, and silence**.

- **65,709 new cases in Q2 2025** — up 2% from 2024, with **over 4,000 children waiting more than two years** for hearings (GOV.UK Family Court Statistics, Sep 2025; NAO, Sep 2025).  
- **90% of private law cases involve domestic abuse** — yet courts routinely fail to recognise or act, risking child safety (TBIJ, Aug 2025; Guardian, Oct 2025).  
- **Advice deserts** and **digital exclusion** leave parents without support, with 33% of the population unable to engage online (Nuffield, 2024).  
- **Appeals collapse** because transcripts — the only proof of what was said — are late, expensive, or missing, amplified by covert recordings amid trust loss (CommunityCare, May 2025).  

> **“They can’t tell us how many transcripts they make. That’s not transparency. That’s a blackout.”**

This is not just a backlog.  
It is **systemic re-traumatisation** of children and survivors.

The solution is not more judges.  
It is **transparency** — but not the kind courts think.

Transparency is not press access (extended to all courts Jan 2025 — Judiciary.uk).  
It is **verbatim records** that become **templates** for faster, safer decisions — revealing abuse patterns, empowering early interventions, preventing court entry.  

**Transcripts are the bedrock.**  

This article asks:  
**How do we boost transcript production and access — with the least resistance?**  

We answer using:  
- Official forms and guidance  
- Real user experiences (JustAnswer, Transparency Project)  
- Transcription company contracts  
- FOI evidence of the data void  

The revolution is not a new law.  
**It is a transcript.**

## 1. Introduction: The Crisis

The family justice system in England and Wales continues to operate under severe and sustained pressure. As of May 2025, the National Audit Office (NAO) reports that **nearly 50,000 family cases remain unresolved**, comprising **10,121 public law applications** involving children at risk of care or adoption and **37,541 private law disputes** concerning child arrangements.[^1] Approximately **4,000 children have waited more than two years** for a substantive hearing, with average legal aid expenditure per public law case having **doubled from £6,000 to £12,000** between 2018 and 2022 — representing an annual cost escalation of £314 million.[^2] The statutory 26-week time limit for concluding care proceedings, introduced by the *Children and Families Act 2014*, **has not been met in any reporting year since its enactment** — a failure persisting for over a decade.[^3]

Amid this backdrop of systemic delay, the **Family Court’s inaugural Annual Report** (October 2023–September 2024) presents a narrative of incremental reform.[^4] Public law applications **declined from 19,306 in 2018 to 15,552 in 2023**, while disposals **increased to 16,871** — the highest in six years.[^5] The report acknowledges a “**substantial backlog**” but highlights interventions including the relaunched **Public Law Outline**, the **Pathfinder pilot** in private law (reducing average case duration by 11 weeks in pilot courts), and the progressive implementation of digital systems.[^6]

Practitioner evidence, however, reveals a significant disjuncture between administrative metrics and lived experience. **Warners Solicitors** observe:  
> “Children are losing critical developmental windows, parents are exhausting financial and emotional reserves, and contact arrangements are collapsing — all in the absence of any predictable listing timeline.”[^7]

Within this context of **delay, reform, and experiential harm**, **transparency has emerged as a central policy objective**. The Annual Report positions its own publication as a “**key step in the general move… towards greater transparency**”.[^8] Following the 2021 Transparency Review, the **Reporting Pilot** — permitting accredited journalists to attend and publish anonymised accounts of family proceedings — now operates in **approximately half of all Family Court areas**, with **full national rollout scheduled for early 2025**.[^9]

This article contends that **transcripts constitute the evidentiary foundation of meaningful transparency**. In the absence of routine, accurate, and accessible verbatim records, current reforms — including media access and judgment publication — remain limited in scope and impact. The analysis is guided by four research questions:

1. What do official forms and guidance reveal about transcript requirements and processes?  
2. How do user experiences of transcript access diverge from official procedures?  
3. What are the operational and contractual constraints imposed by transcription service providers?  
4. What are the least-resistant mechanisms for increasing transcript production and publication?

The methodology comprises documentary analysis of legal forms, procedural rules, and transcription company terms; anecdotal evidence from user platforms; and Freedom of Information data. The findings identify a critical data void — exemplified by the Ministry of Justice’s non-response to a May 2025 FOI request for transcript processing metrics — and propose targeted, low-resistance interventions across data collection, administrative procedures, user support, and provider contracts.
