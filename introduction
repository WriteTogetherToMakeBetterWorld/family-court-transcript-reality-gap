## Introduction (v0.1 – Draft)

The Byline Times article “Family Justice in Crisis: Thousands of Children Waiting Years for Court Decisions,” published on 21 May 2025 by David Hencke, draws on a National Audit Office (NAO) report to expose systemic delays in England’s family courts, with nearly 50,000 unresolved cases—including 10,121 care and 37,541 custody disputes—leaving approximately 4,000 children waiting over two years for hearings due to insufficient facilities and administrative failures (Hencke, 2025). The piece underscores that the Coalition Government’s 2014 statutory 26-week limit for public family law cases has never been met in the intervening 11 years, while private cases lack any maximum deadline, resulting in regional disparities (e.g., custody cases exceeding one year in Sussex and Somerset versus 24 weeks for public and 18 weeks for private cases in Wales). Legal aid spending per local authority case doubled from £6,000 to £12,000 between 2018 and 2022, yet the Government spends £1.8 billion annually on a fragmented family justice system whose total taxpayer cost remains unknown owing to split accountability across the Ministry of Justice, Department for Education, HM Courts and Tribunals Service, and Cafcass. NAO head Gareth Davies highlights “poor quality data and fragmented decision-making” as barriers to reform, despite Government claims of progress via the Pathfinder pilot and £500 million early-intervention investment. **This article contends that, within this landscape of chronic delay, even minor transcription inaccuracies—compounded by repeated hearings, outdated assessments, and administrative overload—pose a material risk to fair trial (Article 6 ECHR) and family life (Article 8 ECHR) rights, particularly in private law custody disputes where judicial memory and evidential continuity are paramount.**
